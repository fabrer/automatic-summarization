If the players win, the owners will be liable for about dlrs 800 million in guaranteed salaries, although they have vowed to appeal if they lose.
The league already has sued the players over Feerick's jurisdiction.
``But I don't think there will be anybody celebrating because there's no guarantee that it will end the lockout.
The league made a counterproposal Friday, asking that the tax be imposed with a much lower threshold.
It's unlikely any negotiations will be held this week, since the union is holding a meeting for all NBA players and the agents advisory committee in Las Vegas from Wednesday through Friday.
``We've got to get a sense of where the players are, what they consider to be reasonable and what they're willing to do in order to get the season to commence,'' Hunter said.
The union filed a grievance with Feerick before the lockout was imposed July 1 over the owners' announcement June 29 that they would not honor guaranteed deals.
In a six-day hearing over the summer, the union argued that owners should have protected themselves from being liable for guaranteed salaries during a work stoppage by inserting lockout language into the standard player contract.
The Sacramento Kings inserted a lockout clause into center Olden Polynice's contract in 1994, and it was approved by the league.

Alan Greenspan, I am sure, would agree that this salary cap is convoluted enough to give anyone a headache, so let's just say it is a cap that does not exist when a team is negotiating with one of its own.
He and Magic Johnson created a basketball renaissance that began during a college title showdown in Salt Lake City and spread worldwide, like an infectious smile.
The owners, as always, are exaggerating their misery, but this time, it is much easier to not root for the players.
Ewing leads the fight to protect the $100 million contracts for 21-year-olds who have achieved not a single playoff victory, linked to the big payoffs for agents like his friend Falk.
Citing stalled negotiations with the Players Association over a new collective bargaining agreement, league officials said they would decide next week whether to cancel the first week of regular season games.
While the decision had been expected for 10 days, it nonetheless sent a strong signal that the owners and players will probably be willing to cancel at least part of the regular season in order to settle their labor dispute.
Both sides agree that it would take at least three weeks to hold abbreviated training camps and sign over 200 free agents to new contracts.
Privately, officials on both sides do not believe the season will start as scheduled on Nov.
``Since we're not even negotiating, you have to conclude it's very likely that we're going miss some part of the regular season,'' deputy commissioner Russ Granik said Monday night.
``We'll try and defer any decisions until the last minute, but right now it does not look good.
Neither Granik nor players association executive director Billy Hunter sounded as if this week's meeting would go a long way toward the signing of a new agreement _ the precursor to playing again.
``I don't think you have any choice but to miss games at this point,'' Hunter said.
``In fact, I think the they've intended it all along.
Monday in 11 cities throughout the country, the players are holding make-shift press conferences at training-camp venues, NBA arenas and gymnasiums.
8 percent of total basketball-related income.
Called the Larry Bird exception, it was created to allow the Hall of Fame Boston Celtics forward to re-sign with the Celtics near the end of his career.
But with exorbitant salaries paid to several unproven stars over the last few years and $100 million deals sprouting up routinely, the owners are determined to swing the income pendulum back toward themselves by enforcing a restricted salary cap _ a hard cap _ and putting a ceiling on how much one player could earn.
``Last year, the players received about $1 billion dollars in salaries and benefits and we have made proposals that are guaranteed to increase that number by 20 percent over the next four years,'' Granik said in a prepared statement.
``Our proposals would result in an average player salary of more than $3.
Through tickets sales alone, Granik estimated that losing the exhibition season would cost the league between $35 million and $40 million.
Thursday's bargaining session has suddenly become the last hope at starting the season on time.
On the day when training camps were scheduled to begin, players from across the country held news conferences in 14 NBA cities to proclaim themselves ready to practice for the regular season.
``We want to show the public that we, as players, want to play,'' said Ewing, who was flanked by five teammates.
``Today is supposed to be the start of training camp.
With wide philosophical differences on how $2 billion annual income should be distributed, both sides have privately said they don't expect to play a regular season game before December.
Billy Hunter, the union's executive director, offered a glimmer of hope.
I'm prepared to make a quantum leap.
That clause represents the major rift in negotiations.
``I don't know if this is going to come to a speedy resolution,'' Ewing said.
That means missing paychecks in November, something Ewing said the players are prepared to do.
Feerick's decision could give new leverage to one side.
Still, a five-hour meeting that was described as cordial by the league and ``almost like two bulls letting off a little steam'' by the players association produced another scheduled round of talks next Tuesday.
Barring a major compromise, that will not be enough time to preserve a full season and prevent the league from losing its first regular-season games to labor strife in November.
Russ Granik, the NBA's deputy commissioner, said the league would wait until after next week's meeting before deciding to cancel regular-season games.
He also discussed the possibility of a significantly shortened season.
``But we recognize that beyond a certain point we can't possibly sell to our fans that we're having an NBA season.
Patrick Ewing, the union president, and vice presidents Herb Williams and Dikembe Mutombo attended the meeting with the union's executive director, Billy Hunter, and union lawyers.
No owners were present, but Granik, Commissioner David Stern and the league's lawyers spent most of the day explaining the intricacies of a two-week-old proposal to the players.
At one point before the two parties broke for lunch, Stern and Hunter raised their voices and accused each other of handling their constituencies poorly, a participant in the meeting said.
The NBA's deputy commissioner, Russ Granik, announced the cancellation after nearly three and a half hours of meetings concluded at a Manhattan hotel.

``We tried our best today to try to do what was possible to salvage the season,'' said Alonzo Mourning, the Miami Heat center.
Taking into account that a three- to four-week period would be needed for training camp and free-agent signings before the season starts, the league said it would decide in two weeks whether to make further cancellations.
``I'm very sad and disappointed,'' said the NBA commissioner, David Stern.
Seventeen players, including union president Patrick Ewing and vice presidents Mitch Richmond, Herb Williams, Dikemebe Mutombo and Ty Corbin, attended the meeting along with Stern, Granik and five members of the ownership committee _ Madison Square Garden president Dave Checketts and owners Abe Pollin of Washington, Gordon Gund of Cleveland, Les Alexander of Houston and Jerry Colangelo of Phoenix.
The talks featured what the players association implied were a bevy concessions made to the owners that they felt would accommodate the league's desire to swing the revenue pendulum back toward the owners.
The dispute involves the distribution of approximately $2 billion in league-wide income.
While the players did not discuss the elimination of the Larry Bird exception _ a clause that allows a player to secure any amount of money he wants in re-signing with his current team _ they did address the exception in their taxation proposal.
The main points were as follows: _ A 50 percent tax would be imposed on salary earned above $18 million, a clause that would affect only a few players who exercised their Bird rights.
For example, if a player made $20 million, the team would be forced to put $1 million into a fund that would most likely be distributed to low-revenue teams.
Whatever figure over that number reduces the salary cap the next year.
But the players would have an assurance that the salary cap would go up at least $2 million before the credit goes into effect.
_ Also, if the 63-percent threshold is met, a reduction of annual 20 percent raises would take effect for multi-year contracts.
The union said this clearly addresses the league's desire to bring salaries in line with revenues.

_ Teams would get a right of first refusal on free agents after the fourth year for incoming rookies, meaning a player would be contractually obligated to the same team for the first four years of his deal.
Currently, the rookie scale is three years and includes a clause that enables a player to exercise his Bird rights after two seasons _ a clause Kevin Garnett parlayed into an astronomical $126 million deal last year with Minnesota.
_ Finally, the players agreed to make marijuana a banned substance.
This would allow every team above the salary cap being able to sign one free agent per year for the average salary _ currently $2.

But neither the players nor the owners are counting on the ruling by the arbitrator, John Feerick, to speed up negotiations, especially if Feerick finds in favor of the players, an award that could approach $800 million in salaries.
NBA attorneys have indicated to the union that if the decision goes against management, they will seek to have it vacated by appealing to the U.
The league has other litigation pending in U.
``But we understand that won't end the lockout.
The union argued that owners should have protected themselves by inserting clauses about non-payment for lockouts and strikes into individual player contracts.
In support of its arguments, the union pointed to clauses in a few individual player contracts that contained language precluding payment during a lockout.
The league is relying on the basic tenets of labor law, which hold that employees not be paid during strikes or lockouts.
The deterrent factor of a lockout is that employees subject to a collective bargaining agreement do not get paid once the agreement expires and they are unable to reach a new agreement.
They would essentially be paid for not playing basketball.
But Hunter disputed this notion, and in a conference call Friday talked openly about the entire season's being canceled before the players would back away from their ultimate goals.
``I'm not at all concerned,'' Hunter said.
'' Another significant development may be thedeparture of many players to Europe until the dispute is settled, according to at least two player agents.
Proposals exchanged last week that included the concept of a luxury-tax system on player salaries appeared to reflect the first signs of progress in negotiations since the lockout began July 1.
But both sides have termed the figures in each other's proposal as unacceptable, and it was unclear whether either side was willing compromise.
``When they explored the idea of a tax system, we were taking the players at their word that they wanted to make some headway.

There is a real possibility that most, if not all, of the coming season will be canceled.
But Michael Jordan made $33 million.
The union says it is worried about that middle class, but seems determined to preserve the free market.
But the union is acting unhurried.
But if the players go that route, it could be a long time before real negotiations get going.
That was what all the seers said four years ago, when baseball's World Series was canceled by labor troubles.
