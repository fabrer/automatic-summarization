Wall Street extended a global stock selloff Thursday with the Dow 
industrials tumbling more than 200 points for a second straight day. 
The Dow Jones industrial average, which plunged 237.90 points on Wednesday, 
fell an additional 210.09, or by 2.7 percent, to close at 7,632.53. 
Broader market indicators also sank sharply in heavy trading. Bank 
and technology stocks were particularly hard hit. The selling spree, 
amid worries about shrinking corporate profits and fears of new financial 
crises, left the Dow 18.3 percent, or more than 1,700 points, below 
the all-time high of 9,337.97 reached on July 17. It was getting closer 
to the low of 7,400 that was reached during trading Sept. 1, before 
Wall Street's best-known indicator began a comeback bid that brought 
it above 8,100 as recently as Monday. The Dow's 12.4 percent slide 
in the third quarter, which ended Wednesday, was its worst quarterly 
performance in eight years. It now is 3.5 percent below where it began 
this year. Stock prices earlier plunged in Asia, with Tokyo shares 
falling 1.6 percent to a new 12-year low, and shares were falling 
sharply in Europe, where Germany's central bank left interest rates 
unchanged. Blue chips in London sank 3.1 percent to close at new lows 
for the year, while the key index in Frankfurt, Germany, closed down 
5.5 percent and the main indicator in Paris was off 5 percent. The 
selloff in stocks has sent a flood of money into U.S. Treasury securities, 
a traditional haven in times of uncertainty. Yields on 30-year Treasury 
bonds fell further below 5 percent Thursday, reaching levels unseen 
for long-term government bonds since 1967. Traders were alarmed to 
see prices on the New York Stock Exchange nosedive 2.9 percent on 
Wednesday, even though the Federal Reserve had lowered a key interest 
rate one-quarter percentage point on Tuesday. Some traders were disappointed 
that the cut was not deeper amid fears a go-slow approach would not 
do enough to counter the economic crises that have swept through Asia 
and Russia and are threatening Latin America. ``The smaller-than-expected 
lowering of interest rates by the U.S. Federal Reserve has a chain 
reaction,'' said Lee Won-ho, an analyst at Samsung Securities Co. 
in Seoul, South Korea, where the main stock index fell by 1.5 percent. 
``It is affecting Wall Street, the Japanese market, ours and others.'' 
The managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Michel Camdessus, 
on Thursday said the Fed made the right decision in cutting rates 
and that global powers now must push for stronger growth to offset 
steep recessions in Asia and Russia. Asked why stock markets, particularly 
in the United States, have reacted so negatively to the Fed rate cut, 
Camdessus said he believed confidence will soon be restored, especially 
if financial leaders show resolve in their discussions over the next 
week. There also are worries about where the next financial market 
crisis may erupt after last week's dlrs 3.6 billion private bailout 
of Long-Term Capital Management LP of Greenwich, Connecticut. In addition, 
investors worldwide worry that the downturn on Wall Street could signal 
a possible slowdown in economic growth _ a bad omen for the many foreign 
companies dependent on exports to the huge U.S. market. ``There's 
a psychological impact overall, but there's also a direct impact on 
companies like Sony and TDK which derive a high percentage of their 
earnings from overseas markets,'' said Pelham Smithers, a stock strategist 
in Tokyo at ING Baring Securities (Japan) Ltd. A new survey in Japan 
said confidence among small- and medium-sized businesses about the 
economy plunged to its worst level since the Bank of Japan began the 
quarterly samplings in 1967.

President Boris Yeltsin would respond strongly to any effort to prohibit 
Russians from buying foreign currencies, believing the move would 
be like bringing another Iron Curtain down on the country, his spokesman 
said Friday. ``The president clearly understands that such a ban would 
be a clear violation of our rights ... that would mean a return to 
the Iron Curtain in everyday life,'' said presidential spokesman Dmitry 
Yakushin. The remarks came after media reports of a government economic 
plan in the works that would prohibit Russians from buying U.S. dollars 
and other foreign currencies, and institute other strict economic 
controls, rolling back seven years of reforms. Though government officials 
say such a plan is only one of six possibilities, Prime Minister Yevgeny 
Primakov warned Thursday that he might be forced to take ``unpopular'' 
measures to rescue the Russian economy if it does not receive the 
next installment in a dlrs 22.6 billion loan from the International 
Monetary Fund. Central Bank Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko and Finance 
Minister Mikhail Zadornov flew to Washington on Friday for negotiations 
with the IMF over the dlrs 4.3 billion installment. IMF officials 
have said they want the Russian government to come up with a sound 
economic program before the loan is given, and have made it clear 
that currency controls and boosting the money supply by printing rubles 
are not acceptable. But Primakov said that the country's plan would 
be dependent on the IMF loan, not the other way around. No short-term 
economic plan will be known for another three weeks, long after the 
IMF is set to make its decision, said First Deputy Prime Minister 
Vadim Gustov. A draft version of the government's fourth-quarter budget 
would rely heavily on the IMF loan, the Kommersant newspaper said. 
Without the loan, the government would have to engage in major deficit 
spending. Calls for Soviet-style controls _ part of the plan drafted 
by First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov and leaked to the press 
_ have apparently created a rift within the Cabinet. The plan drew 
heavy criticism from Zadornov, and Gerashchenko called the idea of 
banning foreign currency sales ``a mad idea.'' Meanwhile, Russia's 
stock market dropped by 5 percent to 38.8 Friday, but trading was 
so light the downward move meant little. The stock market has continued 
to fall since the crisis hit Aug. 17. And tax collection was down 
in September, the result of the collapse in Russia's banking system, 
said Alexander Pochinok, head of the government's finance and credit 
department. Revenues totaled 14.3 billion rubles (dlrs 875 million), 
700 million rubles (dlrs 43 million) less than expected. The government 
wants to reverse this trend by raising taxes for oil and gas companies, 
but the idea is expected to meet sharp resistance in the lower house 
of Russia's parliament, which wants to cut tax rates, Pochinok said.

President Leonid Kuchma called Friday for ``corrections'' to Ukraine's 
program of market reforms, but pledged that reforms would continue. 
Kuchma did not elaborate in his comments to a group of Ukrainian economists, 
saying only that the changes were necessary because of the country's 
economic problems. Kuchma urged the economists to come up with recommendations 
before a national meeting of economists in November, the Interfax 
news agency reported. Ukraine has suffered economic problems since 
the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union and it has been especially hard 
hit by the financial crisis in neighboring Russia, its main trading 
partner. The Russian crisis has hurt bilateral trade, caused the Ukrainian 
currency to fall and led to a withdrawal of investors from Ukraine. 
In recent months, Kuchma has implemented some economic reforms by 
decree, prompting the International Monetary Fund to release the first 
installment of a long-awaited dlrs 2.2 billion loan. Many reforms, 
however, remain stalled. National Bank chairman Viktor Yushchenko 
was in Washington this week for consultations with IMF officials. 
Yushchenko has warned that the bank would not spend its dwindling 
reserves to support the hryvna currency, but has avoided comments 
on the currency in recent days. Kuchma met Friday with Yushchenko, 
Prime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko and other senior officials to 
discuss ways to stabilize the hryvna. The government's press service 
said they focused on possible ways to keep the hryvna under 3.5 to 
the U.S. dollar through the end of the year. The hryvna has been trading 
at 3.4 to the dollar in recent days but trading has been limited. 
There are wide expectations in Ukraine that the hryvna will fall even 
further, and Ukrainians have been stocking up on food, clothing and 
household goods to save their fast-devaluing money. 
 APW19981002.0809 
Ukraine's parliament on Friday refused to approve President Leonid 
Kuchma's decree establishing a state fund to compensate people for 
savings lost in banks. Deputies voted 240-47 to prepare a revised 
version of the decree and debate it later in the month. They must 
consider the decree by Oct. 10, or else it automatically takes effect 
under the constitution. Leftist factions, which voted against the 
proposed legislation, said it would not fully guarantee the return 
of savings lost during the financial instability that has recently 
hit Ukraine. The fund Kuchma proposed to establish would have accumulated 
money in a special National Bank account and repay people in case 
the bank they kept their savings in went bankrupt or became insolvent. 
Although the decree provided for compensation of deposits amounting 
only to 500 hryvna (dlrs 147 at the current exchange rate), its authors 
said it would cover more than 90 percent of Ukrainians who keep their 
money in banks. The measure was meant to prevent mass withdrawals 
of deposits that most Ukrainian banks have already experienced as 
people, scared by the fall of the national currency and the turmoil 
in neighboring Russia, started to stock up on food, clothing and household 
goods. Government officials say that Ukrainians have recently withdrawn 
at least 10 percent of the 3 billion hryvna (dlrs 882 million) they 
deposited in banks. 
 APW19981003.0292 
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said Saturday that the economic crisis 
would not bring an end to the government's program of privatizing 
state property. ``Privatization will be accomplished for growth of 
production, growth of investment and growth of production effectiveness 
through renewal of major funds,'' Primakov said during a meeting of 
Western businessmen. ``We shall conduct privatization so that it serves 
the interests of the people, the state, and business,'' he said, according 
to the ITAR-Tass news agency. Primakov reassured the businessmen, 
members of the prime minister's consultive council on foreign investment 
in Russia, that the government had no plans to ban the circulation 
of U.S. dollars in Russia. But, he said, the government would take 
steps to staunch the flow of dollars from Russia. Responding to media 
reports of a government economic plan that would prohibit Russians 
from buying U.S. dollars and other foreign currency, Primakov said 
the reports ``absolutely do not correspond to reality,'' ITAR-Tass 
quoted him as saying. He said there was no need to regulate the influx 
of dollars into Russia, but the government should take steps to prevent 
what he called ``the dollar drain.'' Russian companies stashed about 
dlrs 2.5 billion outside the country in September alone, the Interfax 
news agency reported Friday, quoting central bank figures. Primakov 
said foreign investors are ``the force'' that will help Russia to 
minimize its losses from the current economic crisis. ``We are very 
much interested in foreign investments, especially in ones that go 
into the real production sector,'' Primakov said, according to Interfax. 
``We need a continuous dialogue with foreign investors, without whom 
it will be difficult for us to overcome the current difficulties.'' 
He said Russia wanted long-term investments. ``Foreign capital has 
been coming to the country via short-term operations,'' Primakov said. 
This, he said, ``is not to our liking or yours.'' Viktor Gerashchenko, 
the central bank chairman, said on Friday that the government must 
act to stem the flow of dollars from Russia. Gerashchenko and Finance 
Minister Mikhail Zadornov were in Washington Saturday for the annual 
meeting of the International Monetary Fund, where they plan to spell 
out the measures Russia is taking to bail out its finance system. 
Russia wants the IMF to release the second dlrs 4.3 billion installment 
of a loan that was approved in July, a month before the country's 
economy crashed and the government effectively defaulted on its foreign 
loans. IMF officials have said they want the Russian government to 
come up with a sound economic program before the installment is given, 
and have made it clear that currency controls and boosting the money 
supply by printing rubles are not acceptable.

Russia's new prime minister picked an unusual way to reassure the 
nation Thursday. After two weeks of deliberations he announced that 
he still had no plan to rescue the country from its economic crisis. 
``I want to repeat once more _ there is no program,'' Prime Minister 
Yevgeny Primakov said. ``It has yet to be worked out.'' In most nations 
such a statement might provoke alarm. But Primakov was seeking to 
calm an anxious public that was worried that the Kremlin's cure could 
be worse than the disease. It is not as if Russians do not have something 
to be concerned about. Thursday Primakov convened a meeting of top 
aides to try to hammer out a strategy for overcoming the economic 
woes. A main item on the agenda was the plan drafted by Yuri Maslyukov, 
a Communist and the government's senior policy maker on economic issues. 
It did not take long for Maslyukov's plan to hit the street. A newspaper, 
Kommersant Daily, published it in full Thursday morning. Not surprisingly 
Maslyukov's plan calls for a greater state role in the economy, including 
controls on hard currency. A new State Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development would be established using the ``nationalized assets'' 
of failed commercial banks. Wages and pensions would be paid in two 
months, and the minimum wage would be indexed to inflation. There 
would be huge tax cuts, a combination that suggested that the government 
was committed to printing additional money. The exchange rate of the 
ruble would be set by the central bank, based on changes in inflation 
and the balance of payments. Maslyukov's plan also implies that Russians 
would be able to buy dollars at exchanges through the country. It 
stipulates that hard currency could enter the country only with special 
authorization. Exporters would be required to sell most of their hard 
currency reserves. That is an allusion to currency controls that sent 
shock waves through the Russian public. Russians have come to treat 
the dollar as a second currency, and many people have squirreled away 
dollars as a hedge against inflation. ``It is an obvious stupidity,'' 
Otto Latsis, a commentator with the newspaper Noviye Izvestiya, said. 
``People won't give their dollars away. They will go to the black 
market if they need to.'' Yegor Gaidar, the former prime minister 
who favors free markets, said the plan was a ``war against the dollar'' 
and predicted that it would lead to a shortage of imports. As the 
criticism grew, Primakov rushed to distance himself from the talk 
of currency controls. ``The rumors of the state's becoming a monopolist 
on the inflow of hard currency into the country is nonsense,'' he 
said, asserting that the document published by Kommersant Daily was 
just one of six possible plans. Primakov may be opposed to wildly 
unpopular currency controls. He may be worried that the plan would 
would set off the panic buying of dollars, further depressing the 
ruble. Or he may simply be trying to keep his distance from Maslyukov's 
plan while Russia tries to wrangle its next disbursement, $4.3 billion, 
from the International Monetary Fund. The particulars could be modified, 
but many people following the maneuvering say they believe that it 
represents the basic thrust of the government's thinking. Primakov 
has called for greater state regulation and an expansion of the money 
supply, two themes of Maslyukov's plan. The plan also has many similarities 
with the plan presented to the government by Gorbachev-era advisers. 
``We think it is close to being a final document,'' said the United 
Financial Group, a Russian investment business. It is unclear how 
long Primakov can carry on without spelling out a detailed strategy. 
The ousted tax chief, Boris Fyodorov, has argued that the IMF should 
not provide further aid until Primakov has taken tough measures to 
build a free market. Primakov has, however, sought to turn that logic 
on its head, arguing that his government's economic strategy will 
depend on the fund's willingness to provide aid. His aim appears to 
be to pressure the fund by implying that it will be the fund's fault 
if Russia is forced to default on its loans or take draconian measures 
at home. Or as Primakov put it Thursday, without the fund's money, 
Russia will have to impose ``unpopular measures.''

When the world's finance ministers and central bankers gathered last 
year in Hong Kong, they nervously congratulated each other for containing 
_ at least for the moment _ a nasty financial brush fire in Asia. 
In a year's time, many predicted in hallway chatter, the troubles 
in Thailand and Indonesia would look like a replay of Mexico in 1995 
_ a rough bump in the road for a world enjoying remarkable prosperity. 
Talk about bad market calls. Twelve months later, as the same financial 
mandarins clog Washington with their limousines and glide through 
endless receptions at the annual meeting of the International Monetary 
Fund and the World Bank, just about everything that could have gone 
wrong in the world economy has: the worst downturn in Japan since 
World War II, economic meltdown in Russia, a depression in Indonesia 
that is plunging 100 million people below the poverty line, and deep 
fears over what happens next in Latin America. What makes this year's 
IMF meeting most remarkable, though, is that the harshest criticisms 
are directed at the monetary fund itself, and, by extension, at the 
U.S. Treasury, which is viewed as the power behind the IMF. This year, 
in place of confident predictions, there are mutual recriminations. 
Arguments are breaking out over whether the true culprits were crony 
capitalists and weakened leaders like Russian President Boris Yeltsin, 
or huge investors who poured money into the world's emerging markets 
with reckless abandon in the mid-1990s and panicked in the past twelve 
months. Whatever the reason, one reality prevails: Hundreds of billions 
of dollars have fled from economies on four continents _ seeking the 
safest havens possible, often in the United States _ and the money 
is not returning anytime soon. And the subtext of every seminar on 
capital flows and every conclave of nervous ministers will be some 
painfully blunt questions: Can this be stopped? Or is the world headed 
for a global recession? Fifty-three years ago the IMF was created 
after the Bretton Woods conference which sought to stabilize the world 
economy and secure the peace after World War II. Now it is under attack 
from all sides, charged not only with worsening a bad situation by 
misjudging the economics, but with being politically tone-deaf in 
some of the most volatile capitals in the world, from Jakarta, Indonesia, 
to Moscow. For the first time, there are disturbing questions about 
whether the institution itself is still capable, financially or politically, 
of containing the kind of economic contagion that caught the world 
unaware. Once, the IMF's critics were largely found in Africa and 
South Asia, were the fund was often viewed as arrogant; today they 
include Wall Street's biggest players and top officials in the most 
powerful economies of Asia and Europe. Only a few _ including former 
Secretary of State George Schultz and members of Congress who are 
increasingly suspicious of all international institutions _ are talking 
about scrapping the IMF altogether. But almost everyone is talking 
about creating a ``new financial architecture'' that can do what the 
old one clearly cannot: smother financial wildfires before they leap 
around the globe. President Clinton, British Prime Minister Tony Blair 
and other leaders, after months of silence, have edged into the debate, 
in some cases wresting the issue for the first time from their finance 
ministers and central banks. Their fear, their advisers say, is that 
15 months of financial turmoil are now threatening political stability. 
Such concerns have turned this year's meeting into a tumbled mass 
of worries and a groping for short and long-term solutions. The Japanese, 
the French, the Southeast Asians are all arriving in Washington with 
different diagnoses of what went wrong, and different solutions about 
how to set it right. The United States has its own set of plans, a 
mix of suggestions to force more disclosure of financial data in countries 
around the world and to impose more American-style financial standards 
and regulation. Meanwhile, an ideological argument is breaking out 
over whether the world should slow down a long march toward more free 
and open markets _ a strategy pressed by the Clinton administration 
for the past six years. Others argue that it is unwise to start rebuilding 
the hospital while the patients are still on the operating tables. 
``Last year the standard answer that all of us were given came down 
to this: `We have the IMF and the World Bank, and they know best,''' 
Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said over breakfast in Washington 
the other day, reflecting on how the crisis turned 30 years of astounding 
growth in his country into an overnight depression. ``Then they said 
everything that went wrong was our fault,'' he said. ``But now, now 
I think people know that much of the problem came from the outside, 
and we need something better.'' And the IMF itself is beginning to 
fight back, an awkward role for an institution dominated by Ph.D. 
economists who are unaccustomed to being openly challenged. ``Every 
place you turn you read the same story, that we came in, that we made 
things worse,'' said Stanley Fischer, the deputy managing director 
of the fund, who was born in Northern Rhodesia _ now Zambia _ and 
became chairman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's economics 
department before taking a job that has now put him in the center 
of the financial storm. ``We frequently get the blame, some of it 
well-deserved,'' he said. ``But it is politically convenient for governments 
around the world to cry, `The IMF made us do it,' and pin their mistakes 
on us. That's fine. We'd rather be loved, but more than that we'd 
like to be effective.'' MISCALCULATIONS, POLITICS AND SAFETY NETS 
On a steaming January day, Michel Camdessus, the IMF's top official, 
slipped into Jakarta to the private residence of President Suharto 
and sat down for a four-hour meeting to tick off, line by line, the 
huge reforms Indonesia would have to implement in return for tens 
of billions of dollars in emergency aid. Two previous deals had collapsed 
when Suharto ignored the fund's conditions, so Camdessus insisted 
that he strike a deal directly with Suharto, then Asia's longest-serving 
leader. It was a meeting of men who knew different worlds of power 
politics: Suharto rose as a general in central Java, and Camdessus 
had detonated mines in Algeria for the French army before entering 
the French Treasury on his way to becoming head of France's central 
bank. ``It was all there,'' a senior IMF official recalled. ``He was 
told he had to dismantle the national airplane project, the clove 
monopoly, all the distribution monopolies.'' At one point, Camdessus 
looked at the impassive Suharto and said, ``You see what this means 
for your family,'' a reference to their vast investments in the country's 
key industries. ``He said, `I called in my children, and they all 
understand.''' But within months, that exchange in Jakarta came to 
symbolize the IMF's twin troubles: Its inability to understand and 
reckon with the national politics of countries in need of radical 
reform, and its focus on economic stabilization rather than the social 
costs of its actions. Suharto had no intention of fulfilling the agreement. 
It was, one of his former Cabinet members said, ``a delaying move 
that was obvious to everyone except Camdessus.'' Perhaps one reason 
why the IMF sometimes appears tone-deaf is that its senior staff is 
almost entirely composed of Ph.D. economists. There are few officials 
with deep experience in international politics, much less the complexities 
of Javanese culture that were at work in Indonesia. Historically, 
experts in politics and security have gravitated to the United Nations, 
development experts to the World Bank, and economists to the IMF _ 
creating dangerous gaps in a crisis like this one. As a result, the 
fund had only a rudimentary understanding of what would happen if 
its demands were met and all Indonesia's state monopolies were quickly 
dissolved. While that system lined the pockets of the Suhartos and 
their friends, it also distributed food, gasoline and other staples 
to a country that stretches for 3,000 miles over thousands of islands. 
To help balance the budget, the fund demanded a quick end to expensive 
subsidies that keep the price of food and gasoline artificially low. 
But that, combined with the huge currency devaluation that sparked 
the crisis, resulted in high prices and shortages that fueled riots 
that continue to this day, as millions of Indonesians lose their jobs. 
The IMF _ unintentionally, its officials insist _ also sped Suharto's 
resignation, insisting on the elimination of ``crony capitalism,'' 
code words for removing the Suharto family from the center of the 
economy. Ultimately, that may prove to be Indonesia's salvation, if 
the new government can contain the rioting against the ethnic Chinese 
minority _ whose money is desperately needed to save the country's 
fast-shrinking economy. ``It is worth noting,'' Fischer said this 
week, ``that our programs in Asia _ in Indonesia, Korea and Thailand 
_ only took hold after there was a change in government.'' Nonetheless, 
the Indonesia experience has revived the argument that the IMF is 
so focused on stabilizing banks and currencies, on preventing capital 
flight and freeing up markets, that it is blind to the social costs 
of its actions. Among the toughest critics has been its sister institution, 
the World Bank, whose main charge is alleviating poverty. ``You've 
seen the tension almost every day,'' one senior World Bank official 
said recently. The bank has gone to extraordinary lengths in recent 
months to differentiate its role from that of the fund, and to announce 
a tripling of aid to the poorest in the countries hit by the economic 
chaos. Even U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan has joined the argument, 
warning in a speech at Harvard recently that ``if globalization is 
to succeed, it must succeed for poor and rich alike. It must deliver 
rights no less than riches. It must be harnessed to the cause not 
of capital alone, but of development and prosperity for the poorest 
of the world.'' IMF officials say they are changing strategies when 
they see they are exacting too great a social cost. ``It's a very 
difficult formula to get exactly right,'' Fischer said in August, 
as Russia was teetering and the IMF was sending in $4.8 billion in 
aid that was rapidly wasted. ``You need enough discipline to send 
the right message to the markets and keep investors from fleeing. 
But you need enough leeway to keep people from suffering more than 
they otherwise would.'' In recent months, he noted, the IMF has allowed 
more spending to sustain subsidies for basic goods for longer periods 
in Indonesia, Korea and elsewhere. ``There is a new flexibility at 
the IMF'' a senior Indonesian official concluded recently. ``It is 
a lot better.'' A U.S. PAWN, OR A RUNAWAY AGENCY? The Clinton administration 
admits that the IMF has many failings, many of them on display this 
year. But it insists that the world has gone through global financial 
crises without an IMF once before in this century _ and the result 
was the 1930s. ``I have no doubt the situation over the past year 
would have been much worse _ with greater devaluations, more defaults, 
more contagion, and greater trade dislocations _ without the program 
agreed with the IMF and the finance it has provided,'' Deputy Treasury 
Secretary Lawrence Summers told Congress last week. Many Republicans 
and some Democrats are unconvinced. Even though the Senate has overwhelmingly 
approved an $18 billion contribution to the fund to help it fight 
new crises, the House defeated that measure two weeks ago. The fund's 
last hope of getting the money, which will free up nearly $100 billion 
in contributions from other nations waiting for the United States 
to act, will come when the House and Senate try to resolve their budget 
differences in a conference committee in the next 10 days. A rejection, 
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin insists, would send a message around 
the world that the United States is turning its back on the one institution 
charged with restoring economic stability. Everywhere else in the 
world, though, politicians and businessmen insist that one of the 
biggest problems with the IMF is that, contrary to the view of Congress, 
it acts as the U.S. Treasury's lap dog. Ask in Jakarta or Moscow, 
and the response is the same: The IMF never ventures far without looking 
back for the approving nod of its master. When the United States weighs 
in, however, is when the IMF is called on to rescue a country in deep 
trouble. Only then does the IMF _ and the U.S. Treasury _ have the 
leverage to extract commitments in return for billions in aid. In 
theory, the U.S. influence is limited: It has an 18.5 percent vote 
in the fund. Germany, Japan, France and Britain have about 5 percent 
each. But in practice the United States usually gets its way, exercising 
its influence behind the scenes, often in interactions between Fischer 
and Summers. The two met when Fischer was on the MIT faculty and Summers 
was a graduate student taking one of his classes, later becoming a 
colleague at MIT. Each served as chief economist of the World Bank. 
It was Summers who was instrumental in placing Fischer in the fund's 
no. 2 job, and these days they talk constantly. ``It's usually a warm 
relationship,'' Fischer said this summer. ``Remember, this is a job 
where you cannot turn to outsiders for advice _ you can't call the 
chief economist at a Wall Street firm, or even many of your academic 
friends, because so many of the issues are confidential.'' The Treasury's 
relations with Camdessus are often more strained as he plays the role 
of world diplomat, traveling the globe and trying to coax along political 
leaders. The tensions were obvious from the start of the Asia crisis. 
The fund made little secret of its displeasure that the United States 
was not offering direct aid to Thailand, a major U.S. ally, as a sign 
of support and confidence. Mindful of the backlash in Congress when 
Mexico was bailed out with U.S. money, that was the last thing the 
Treasury planned to do. Summers, in turn, thought the fund was not 
forcing the Thais to implement its reform commitments rigorously enough 
or disclose their true financial picture. Within the U.S. government 
there was other dissension: The State and Defense Departments felt 
the United States should do more for Thailand, but backed off when 
the Treasury asked if they would like to pony up some aid out of their 
own budgets. There were other conflicts. When Japan used the last 
IMF meeting to propose setting up a $100 billion ``Asia Fund'' _ one 
that would exclude the United States and would probably offer aid 
under much more relaxed conditions than the IMF does. Rubin called 
up Camdessus at breakfast one morning and told him that the Japanese 
proposal would undercut the IMF's authority. ``We've just had a dispute 
with Michel,'' Rubin reported to his aides as he returned to his orange 
juice and croissant. One of them shot back: ``And it's only 8 a.m.'' 
Camdessus backed down at Rubin's insistence and walked away from money 
that Asia could have used. Japan says it will be back with a similar 
proposal this weekend, this time for a $30 billion fund. Camdessus 
has also rankled U.S. officials with statements that amounted to cheerleading 
to reassure the markets _ sometimes in the face of the facts. In June, 
with Russia on its way to collapse, Camdessus declared that ``contrary 
to what markets and commentators are imagining'' about the slow collapse 
of Russia's economy, ``this is not a crisis. This is not a major development.'' 
The bailouts of Russia and South Korea were prime examples of how 
Washington muscles into the IMF's turf as soon as major U.S. strategic 
interests are involved. Last Christmas, as South Korea slipped within 
days of running out of hard currency to pay its debts in December, 
it sent a secret envoy, Kim Kihwan, to work out a rescue package. 
``I didn't bother going to the IMF,'' Kim recalled recently. ``I called 
Summers' office at the Treasury from my home in Seoul, flew to Washington 
and went directly there. I knew that was how this would get done.'' 
Within days the Treasury dispatched David Lipton, its most experienced 
veteran of emergency bailouts, who is leaving his post as undersecretary 
for international affairs this month, to shadow the IMF staff's negotiations 
with the government in Seoul. Fischer was displeased. ``To make a 
negotiation effective, it has to be clear who has the authority to 
do the negotiating,'' he said. WHO LOST RUSSIA? The pattern was repeated 
this summer, when the United States raced to put together a $17 billion 
package for Russia. The IMF's staff in Moscow declared that Russia 
needed no money at all _ it just needed to enact policies that would 
restore confidence in investors. The Americans and Germans came to 
a different conclusion. Soon after, U.S. officials gathered in the 
White House situation room to consider what might happen to Russia 
if the ruble was devalued and market reforms collapsed and to push 
the IMF to come up with emergency money. So the fund began assembling 
a last-ditch program to prop up a country that had resisted its reform 
plans for seven years. Camdessus, though, was still hesitant, questioning 
whether the IMF should risk its scarce resources in Russia. ``We had 
to pull Michel along,'' a senior Treasury official recalled. As it 
turned out, Camdessus' instincts were right while the approach championed 
by Rubin and Summers proved disastrously wrong. The first installment 
of that payment _ $4.8 billion _ was wasted, propping up the currency 
long enough, in the words of one IMF official, ``to let the oligarchs 
get their money out of the country.'' Then Yeltsin reversed his commitments, 
let the ruble devalue anyway, began printing money with abandon and 
fired virtually every reformer in his government _ resulting in a 
collapse of the IMF agreements and the indefinite suspension of its 
aid program. Now, inside the IMF and on Capitol Hill, there are recriminations 
over ``who lost Russia.'' Publicly, Fischer argues that ``there are 
no apologies owed for what we attempted in Russia.'' But some IMF 
officials complain privately that they let Rubin and Summers run roughshod 
over them, striking a deal that fell apart within weeks as the Russian 
parliament rebelled and Yeltsin backed away from his commitments. 
Summers responds that the United States ``took a calculated risk'' 
because ``it was vastly better that Russia succeed than not succeed.'' 
The Russian collapse touched off new rounds of economic contagion, 
with investors fleeing Latin America, and triggering huge losses in 
hedge funds like Long Term Capital, the Greenwich, Conn., investment 
firm that needed to be rescued by Wall Street powerhouses whose money 
it had invested. ``Russia was a turning point,'' said Robert Hormats, 
the vice chairman of Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. ``It made the world 
realize that some countries can fail, even if the IMF and the Treasury 
intercede. And that changed the perception of risk.'' Now, as the 
countries meet to face a future that the IMF has warned could be very 
bleak, they need to reverse those perceptions, or watch countries 
slowly starve for lack of capital. The emerging markets are calling 
for controls on short term investments. The French want a stronger 
IMF. The Americans say the answer is more disclosure, so that investors 
are better warned, and tougher regulation. ``These are usually nice, 
quiet meetings; everyone very polite,'' a top U.S. official said earlier 
this week. ``Not this year.''

In a season of crashing banks, plunging rubles, bouncing paychecks, 
failing cropsand rotating governments, maybe it is not the ultimate 
insult. But the nation that bore Tolstoy and Chekhov, and still regards 
a well-written letter as a labor of love, is buckling a little this 
week, because it can no longer wish good health to Baba Anya in Omsk. 
The Post Office is broke. In 60 of the country's 89 statelike regions, 
more than 1,000 mail cars have been sidetracked, many stuffed with 
up to 18 tons of letters, newspapers and parcels. The state Railway 
Ministry refuses to carry more mail until the Post Office makes good 
on some 210 million rubles in old bills _ about $13 million in today's 
dollars, or $35 million in dollars six weeks ago. Air mail, which 
amounts to one of every four or five letters, was also suspended at 
one of Moscow's major airports until this week, when the Post Office 
coughed up 5 million rubles for old bills. A second airport is still 
demanding 3 million rubles for past-due debts. So much mail is backed 
up that post offices in Moscow and elsewhere have simply stopped accepting 
out-of-town mail, except for areas that can be easily reached by truck. 
Delivery schedules have fallen weeks, and perhaps months, behind. 
``The situation is really extraordinary,'' said Vladimir Sherekhov, 
the deputy chief of mail service administration in the government's 
Communications Committee. ``We've never had anything like this before.'' 
Maybe the Post Office has been lucky. Extraordinary is the rule elsewhere 
in Russia. Until Friday, the lower house of Parliament was preparing 
to sue the government for failure to provide soap, heat, toilet paper 
and copy-machine paper in the legislature's monumental downtown offices. 
It turned out that politicians had exhausted their funds by cutting 
short their recess and returning to address the nation's economic 
crisis. Earlier in the week, officials said Russia's Arctic shipping 
routes may close next month because half the nation's icebreakers 
are in disrepair and there is no money to fix them. The oldest of 
the ships is so ancient that its nickname is Granny. Such anecdotal 
evidence that Russia is losing its wheels, like one of its old, ill-maintained 
Volga sedans, is everywhere. But oddly, real signs of public distress 
are not particularly common, perhaps because the system rarely seems 
to shed a part as big as a postal system. If the U.S. Postal Service 
is increasingly a pipeline for sweepstakes notices and bills, the 
Russian Post Office still holds a special place in the national conversation. 
Russians still write letters to each other, frequently and fervently, 
and many in remote regions get their news through the mail. Millions 
use the mails to ship canned goods and other provisions to needy relatives 
and friends in faraway areas, an especially vital service in winter. 
And in the last few years, the Post Office has become a vehicle for 
a growing mail-order trade in books, clothes and other catalog items 
not readily available outside big cities. Exactly why all this has 
rumbled to a halt is in some dispute. What is clear is that the Post 
Office and the Railway Ministry both suffer from what ails every Russian 
venture, private and public alike: Nobody pays his bills. The state 
Railway Ministry complains that it is continually stiffed by customers 
who believe the railroads are honor-bound to carry freight whether 
they are paid or not. The government has specified nearly 40 categories 
of freight which the railroads must carry for next to nothing. Among 
the biggest deadbeats are the ``power ministries'' _ the military 
and interior departments _ which did not pay during Soviet times and 
feel little need to pay now. ``It's a psychology formed during the 
socialist period,'' said Tatiana Pashkova, the deputy spokeswoman 
for the ministry, ``and the same situation exists with the Post Office. 
We've been in dispute for a very long time. Always we try to understand 
their differences. But we can't carry cargo for free.'' No kidding, 
says the Post Office: It, too, is owed 200 million rubles by government 
agencies, and is barred from raising rates even though freight costs 
are outstripping revenues. Moreover, the Post Office is also required 
by the government to carry some forms of mail, such as pension checks, 
at reduced rates. Officials at the state Communications Department 
say they also suspect an ulterior motive in the railroads' actions: 
a struggle to dominate the thriving mail-order business. ``Here's 
competition between us and the railroads for the delivery of parcels, 
and I think decisions made by the railroads are mainly explained by 
this competition,'' Sherekhov said. ``They blame us for carrying some 
commercial cargoes instead of mail.'' The Railways Ministry's spokeswoman, 
Ms. Pashkova, said such ``commercial cargoes'' are indeed a problem, 
but only because the railroads know that the Post Office has already 
gotten cash to transport the packages. The railroads are still waiting 
for their share of that money, she said. In the meantime, the situation 
has come to a boil. In late September the railroads cut mail service 
in and out of Moscow, effectively decapitating the postal system and 
forcing officials to draft a fleet of trucks to move letters in and 
out of the city. Hundreds of empty and full rail cars have clogged 
some local yards to the point where moving cars into position for 
unloading has become difficult. At last count, 39 loaded cars were 
awaiting service at one yard. And customers are getting angry. ``We've 
gotten all kinds of complaints,'' said Viktor Salikov, a deputy in 
the Communications Department's mail shipping center. ``People are 
even coming to us, searching for mail that was sent weeks ago.''

The United States is disappointed by the economic confusion within 
the new Russian government of Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, said 
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on Friday, and she warned Russia 
about the dangers of an anti-Western policy. In her first comprehensive 
review of U.S.-Russian relations since Primakov was confirmed as prime 
minister last month, Albright said Washington was ``deeply concerned'' 
about Russia's direction and did not think the crisis there would 
soon abate. ``We have heard a lot of talk in recent days about printing 
new money, indexing wages, imposing price and capital controls and 
restoring state management of parts of the economy,'' she told the 
U.S.-Russia Business Council in Chicago. ``We can only wonder if some 
members of Primakov's team understand the basic arithmetic of the 
global economy.'' While praising Primakov, once her counterpart when 
he was foreign minister, as a pragmatist able to cooperate on key 
issues with Washington, she had harsh words of warning for him. ``Our 
initial reaction to some of the direction he's going in has not been 
particularly positive,'' she said, adding, ``The question now is whether 
that cooperation can continue.'' The United States must keep up its 
aid to Russia but is adjusting it to promote the building of democracy 
and student exchanges as well as arms control, Albright said. Washington 
does not favor more direct aid. ``More big bailouts are not by themselves 
going to restore investor confidence in Russia,'' she said. ``In the 
long run, the gap between Russia's needs and its resources must be 
met not by foreign bailouts but by foreign investment.'' Albright 
sharply criticized as self-defeating the ``many voices in Russia who 
want to shift the emphasis in Russia's interaction with America and 
our allies from one of partnership to one of assertiveness, opposition 
and defiance for its own stake.'' Russia could not stand alone in 
the world, she said, and the United States' ability ``to help Russians 
help themselves will go from being merely very, very difficult to 
being absolutely impossible.'' At the same time, she said, Washington 
would not ``assume the worst, for there are still plenty of people 
in Russia who will fight against turning back the clock.'' And she 
urged the world _ and American critics _ to ``be patient with the 
workings of the democratic process in Russia'' and ``not start each 
day by taking a census of reformers in the Kremlin,'' a census that 
American officials themselves promoted before President Boris Yeltsin 
dismissed the previous government. While Moscow may continue to oppose 
any NATO use of force against Serbian forces in the southern province 
of Kosovo, Albright said, NATO must be prepared to act regardless.

If the Communist Party has its way _ and it has been planning for 
months _ millions of Russians will take to the streets on Wednesday 
for some of the biggest demonstrations in years. But now that Communists 
or politicians with the Communist stamp of approval are running the 
country and its economy the question is what the marchers will be 
demonstrating against. President Boris Yeltsin and his economic advisers 
were easy targets two months ago. But Yeltsin seems but a shadow of 
himself today, and his advisers are gone. The Communists, who have 
undergone a sort of resurgence by playing on the discontent, are working 
hard to cast themselves as outsiders in the government that they help 
run _ and to keep the focus of the protests on Wednesday on Yeltsin 
and his policies. Even that strategy may backfire, however, because 
discontent over Yeltsin does not necessarily translate into support 
for his predecessors. An adviser to the Communist Party leader, Gennadi 
Zyuganov, made headlines not long ago when he called the new government 
bourgeois. The characterization was striking, because the new prime 
minister, Yevgeny Primakov, was one of Zyuganov's top choices for 
the post. The deputy prime minister in charge of the economy, Yuri 
Maslyukov, is a Communist Party figure who once headed Gosplan, the 
infamous central-planning program that helped bring the Soviet Union 
to ruin. ``We don't have slogans that are aimed against the government,'' 
the first secretary of the Moscow Communist Party committee, Alexander 
Kuvayev, said in a recent interview. ``All the slogans are aimed against 
the president and the economic course of the country. Only the president 
can fully be blamed for the course that has brought the country to 
this situation.'' Anger over Russia's fate, and their own, is drawing 
some Russians back to Soviet-style slogans and old-style hostility 
toward capitalism. The ardently pro-Communist newspaper Sovietskaya 
Rossiya devoted most of its front page on Thursday to what it said 
were the results of a contest among readers for protest slogans. The 
entries ranged from catchy to kitschy, from, ``Legislator, official, 
banker _ study the Constitution; the exam is Oct. 7,'' to, `` Imperialist! 
Help Russia return the exported capital, and we will pay the debts 
at once.'' Russia has seen nothing approaching this sort of economic 
chaos and despair since 1993, when hyperinflation swept the economy. 
There is no real way of knowing whether the latest travails will produce 
huge and ugly crowds or small, peaceful ones. A deputy editor and 
political analyst at a newsweekly, Itogi, Masha Lipman, said the situation 
was not unlike that of 1993, when Yeltsin sought, and won, a popular 
mandate in a referendum. He used it to dissolve the Communist-dominated 
Parliament and increase his own power. That led to an autumn showdown, 
the shelling of Parliament by tanks and the total defeat, for the 
time being, of Yeltsin's legislative opponents. ``You can interpret 
this demonstration as a Communist mandate, but I don't think they 
will act like Yeltsin,'' Ms. Lipman said. ``Support for the Communists 
is at its smallest level, maybe 20 percent.'' In a survey of 1,714 
people that was released last week the All-Russian Public Opinion 
Center said that nearly half the population supported the idea of 
demonstrations against Yeltsin, but that barely one-tenth were likely 
to participate in any way. ``Nobody is interested in any sort of struggle,'' 
Yuri Levada, who heads the center, said in an interview. ``This is 
mainly a general expression of a great wave of distrust of authorities, 
mainly the president. He's the great scapegoat for all our sins.'' 
There seems to be little enthusiasm for demonstrations of any sort. 
Only a few thousand people turned out Sunday for the fifth anniversary 
of the shelling of Parliament and Yeltsin's subsequent triumph over 
the Communists. The Communist Party and the Federation of Independent 
Russian Unions, a leftist organization that says it is the main sponsor 
of the protests, predict that 9 million Russians will participate 
on Wednesday. The government has vowed to keep order without resorting 
to force. But it is concerned enough that it has summoned 11,000 police 
officers to patrol Moscow and 6,000 military troops to intervene if 
violence erupts. Protests since 1993 have generally been tepid, a 
deep-seated feeling here. Some demonstrations last week, more or less 
practice runs, hinted at similarly dampened marches this year.
