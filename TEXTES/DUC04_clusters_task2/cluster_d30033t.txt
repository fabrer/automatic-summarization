In his most candid remarks yet on the economy, European Central Bank 
President Wim Duisenberg said Friday that growth appears to be slowing 
in the 11 countries adopting the EU common currency _ or euro _ on 
Jan. 1. Despite an area-wide survey that suggested ``a moderation 
in the pace of growth,'' Duisenberg said domestic demand will continue 
to boost the economy. He pointed also to a gradual improvement in 
labor market conditions as supporting growth, as well as interest-rate 
cuts toward the 3.3 percent level of the euro-zone's lowest rate countries. 
Duisenberg, who spoke at an event in London, said the Dec. 1 and Dec. 
22 meetings of the Central Bank's policy-making body will gauge the 
outlook for inflation and the EU economy. The bank, which will set 
monetary policy for the currency bloc, has been under pressure from 
politicians to keep interest rates low to help boost growth and create 
jobs. While inflation is at its lowest levels in decades _ just 1 
percent in the euro-zone _ unemployment in the 11 nations remains 
stubbornly high at 10.9 percent.

In a surprise move, nations adopting the new European currency, the 
euro, dropped key interest rates Thursday, effectively setting the 
rate that will be adopted throughout the euro zone on Jan. 1. Ten 
of the 11 countries adopting the euro dropped their interest rate 
to 3 percent. Italy dropped to 3.5 percent from 4 percent. The coordinated 
move was a key step in preparing for economic union. Setting a common 
interest rates had been a particularly contentious issue as center-left 
governments in Germany and France pressed for lower rates to help 
boost growth and cut unemployment, a stubborn 10.9 percent in the 
euro zone. European Central Bank chief, Wim Duisenberg, gave no hint 
of the rate cuts during a speech in Brussels earlier Thursday, instead 
suggesting that governments should reform rigid labor markets to create 
jobs. In Germany, the biggest economy in the future euro-zone, central 
bankers cut the key interest rate to 3 percent from 3.3 percent. Rates 
before the cuts had varied throughout the future currency zone, from 
3.69 percent in Ireland to 3.2 percent in Austria. The European Central 
Bank said in a statement from its Frankfurt headquarters that the 
move was decided during a meeting Tuesday of its the policy-making 
governing council. The governing council comprises the 11 heads of 
national central banks plus a six-member directorate, including the 
bank president Duisenberg. ``The joint reduction in interest rates 
has to be seen as a de facto decision on the level of interest rates 
with which the (bank) will start ... monetary union,'' the statement 
said, adding the 3-percent rate would be maintained ``for the foreseeable 
future.'' In Germany, central bank president Hans Tietmeyer said the 
move reflected the worsening outlook for European economies, and wasn't 
a capitulation to political pressure Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine. 
``It's not a dramatic step. It wasn't in response to political pressure,'' 
Tietmeyer said, referring to Germany's cut. ``The coordinated rate 
cut could lead to a reduction in the current pessimism and a reduction 
in financial market turbulence,'' he said. But Tietmeyer, head of 
the bank on which the ECB is modeled, promised that the rate cut does 
not signal the start of a volatile monetary policy. ``It's not a shift 
from the Bundesbank's steady-hand policy,'' he said. Growth in Europe 
has been hit by the Asian and Russian economic crises and turbulence 
on international financial markets. Duisenberg has said growth in 
the euro area countries next year will be about 2.5 percent, lower 
than the 3 percent predicted earlier.

Making their first collective decision about monetary policy, the 
11 European nations launching a common currency on Jan. 1 cut interest 
rates Thursday in a surprise move that won market confidence. Ten 
of the 11 countries joining European economic union dropped their 
key interest rate to 3 percent, with Portugal making the most significant 
plunge, from 3.75 percent. Austria made the smallest cut, from 3.2 
percent. The exception was Italy, which cut from 4 to 3.5 percent. 
It is expected to drop to the common rate by the time the euro is 
launched. Unifying the interest rate is a critical step in laying 
the groundwork for monetary union, and analysts generally expected 
rates to settle at around the level of Germany's, 3.3 percent before 
the cut, now 3 percent. However, interest rate levels had become a 
contentious political issue with center-left governments in Germany 
and France pushing for rate cuts to help spur growth and combat unemployment, 
stuck at 10.9 percent in the nations adopting the euro. The head of 
the European Central Bank that will set monetary policy for the euro 
nations, Wim Duisenberg, again on Thursday suggested governments should 
reform rigid labor markets to create jobs, and not pressure him to 
cut rates. The remarks in Brussels _ before the cuts were made _ gave 
no hint that a rate drop was imminent, but made clear his resistance 
to political pressure was as strong as ever. So strong, in fact, that 
Dutch Finance Minister Gerrit Zalm said he had feared the bank would 
delay the decision. ``What had been feared was that, in order to prove 
its independence, the ECB would go against its own analysis and would 
wait longer, which would have been nonsensical,'' Zalm said. Hans 
Tietmeyer, who runs the German Bundesbank on which the ECB is modeled, 
hinted the rate cut was designed to boost confidence in the new currency, 
dampened by global economic crises and Europe's worsening outlook. 
``The coordinated rate cut could lead to a reduction in the current 
pessimism and a reduction in financial market turbulence,'' Tietmeyer 
said. The cuts seemed to have the desired impact. Frankfurt's main 
index closed up 2.1 percent, while France's was up 1.8 percent. The 
cuts also boosted markets in Spain, Belgium, Italy and even Britain, 
which is not among the nations launching the euro. ``The reaction 
is, `Oh good, they're doing a little bit to prop up the euro economy.' 
But confidence has taken quite a hit across Europe recently, and I 
think further action from the ECB will be needed next year, maybe 
down to 2.5 percent,'' James Mitchell, senior London-based strategist 
with Nomura. An economist at the Banque Bruxelles Lambert, Liesbeth 
Van de Craen, said the cuts were timely. ``We are clearly headed for 
a slowdown,'' she said. Until recently, Europe's economies had held 
out relatively well against damage from Asia and Russia's economic 
crises and unstable financial markets. But just two days ago, Duisenberg 
painted the bleakest picture yet of Europe's economies, warning growth 
will likely slow to 2.5 percent next year from earlier expectations 
of 3 percent. The rate cuts may help. By making it cheaper to borrow 
money, rate cuts can lead to more investment and new businesses, making 
it less worthwhile to save and inducing people to spend. That expands 
the economy. The 11 countries launching the euro are Austria, Belgium, 
Ireland, Italy, Finland, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, 
Spain and Portugal.

China made trading in the euro official Monday, announcing authorization 
for the European common currency's use in trade and financial dealings 
starting Jan. 1. The expected announcement from the central People's 
Bank of China and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, carried 
by the official Xinhua News Agency, also authorized the opening of 
euro accounts. ``Financial institutions, enterprises and individuals 
in China can accept and use the euro in economic, trade and financial 
exchanges with 11 members of the European Union effective January 
1, 1999,'' Xinhua reported. ``In addition, they can convert, use and 
open the euro accounts,'' it said. Chinese officials have said the 
government may convert a proportion of its dlrs 145 billion worth 
of foreign exchange reserves into the euro after the currency's Jan. 
1 debut. The 11 countries launching the common currency are Austria, 
Belgium, Ireland, Italy, Finland, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the 
Netherlands, Spain and Portugal.

Two days before the new euro currency goes into effect for 11 European 
Union members, a growing number of Danes believe their country should 
take part, according to a poll published Tuesday. The survey by the 
Megaphone polling institute said 54 percent of the 1,009 people surveyed 
favor Denmark's participation, while 36 percent oppose that. The remaining 
10 percent were undecided. The poll, conducted Dec. 18-22, was broadcast 
by TV2 channel. Denmark is one of four EU countries staying out of 
the monetary union for the time being. After voters in 1992 rejected 
the Maastricht treaty that established the system, Denmark won opt-out 
clauses. The treaty then was approved. Danish voters traditionally 
have been lukewarm supporters of the EU. Although many politicians 
support the unified currency, they have been wary about bringing the 
issue to voters again. A poll published last October showed 46 percent 
of Danes favored the single currency, while 44 percent were opposed. 
It would take another national referendum for Denmark to adopt the 
new currency. The government has said it has no plans to hold a referendum 
before the year 2001.

The annual inflation rate in the 11 nations that adopt the euro as 
their shared currency on Jan. 1 fell to 0.9 percent in November, the 
European Union's statistics agency reported Wednesday. The fall continued 
the steady decline of inflation in the euro-zone over the past year. 
Annual inflation stood at 1 percent in October and 1.6 percent in 
November 1997, according to Eurostat's monthly report. In the 15 nation 
EU as a whole, inflation fell to 1 percent in November compared to 
1.5 percent in the United States and 0.8 percent in Japan. Germany, 
France, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, Portugal, 
Finland, Ireland and Luxembourg are set to adopt the euro as a common 
currency at midnight on New Year's Eve. The latest figures may hint 
at trouble ahead for the euro-zone with significant increases over 
the year in Portugal and Ireland. With the European Central Bank setting 
a common interest rate for the whole bloc, some economists fear the 
low rate designed to boost core EU economies like France and Germany 
may bring overheating in smaller nations with faster growth. There 
was good news for Greece which was kept out of the euro-zone for failing 
to meet economic conditions for joining, including low inflation. 
It's rate was 3.9 percent in November down from 5 percent a year before. 
Greece hops to join the euro-zone in 2001. Denmark, Sweden and Britain 
decided to stay out of the euro for political reasons. Eurostat gave 
the following rates for November 1998, with November 1997 in brackets: 
Sweden, 0.1 (2.7); France, 0.2 (1.4); Germany, 0.6 (1.4); Austria, 
0.5 (1.1); Luxembourg, 0.5 (1.5); Belgium, 0.6 (1.3 percent); Denmark, 
1.1 (1.6); Netherlands, 1.5 (2.5); Finland, 0.9 (1.8); Britain, 1.4 
(1.9); Spain, 1.4 (1.9); Italy, 1.7 (1.8); Portugal, 2.6 (1.9); Ireland, 
2.2 (1.1); Greece, 3.9 (5).

Wim Duisenberg, the head of the new European Central Bank, said in 
an interview published Wednesday that he won't step down after completing 
half his term as earlier agreed. ``I had hoped you wouldn't ask me 
that question. The answer is no,'' Duisenberg told the Le Monde daily, 
which had asked him if he would step down after four years on the 
job. Duisenberg was named this spring as head of the new European 
Central Bank, which will govern the policies of the euro, the new 
single currency which goes into effect Jan. 1. France surprised its 
euro partners by proposing its central banker, Jean-Claude Trichet, 
at the last minute for the job Duisenberg was expected to secure easily. 
Although he was elected easily, Duisenberg agreed to step down after 
four years of his eight year term although he has since said no such 
``gentleman's agreement'' exists. Duisenberg told Le Monde, a newspaper 
that fervently has backed the euro, that the the introduction of the 
new currency is the most ``significant'' step so far toward European 
unification. However, he said that he would like to see further political 
integration, especially in the area of foreign tax and social policies.

Europe's dream of monetary union becomes reality Thursday when 11 
nations irrevocably lock their currencies together to form the euro 
and create an economic giant whose boundaries stretch from beyond 
the Arctic Circle to the shores of the Mediterranean. The euro's birth 
is being hailed as a historic turning point in international finance 
and is arguably the greatest single step in the drive to create a 
united Europe from the ruins of World War II. ``This Dec. 31, 1998, 
will be one of the great dates in the history of the 20th century,'' 
French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn, told France Info radio. 
``It's the beginning of a new era.'' On what Europeans are calling 
``E-day,'' economic and finance ministers from the 11 nations will 
huddle at European Union headquarters to agree to the rates at which 
German marks, Italian lire and the rest are absorbed into euro. Strauss-Kahn 
said the euro would likely be worth 6.56 to 6.57 French francs.

Struggling to avoid being sidelined in the Continent-wide equities 
market promised by Europe's soon-to-be-introduced single currency, 
French authorities said Thursday that the Paris stock exchange would 
join an alliance between London and Frankfurt that is seen as the 
precursor of a pan-European market. The Bourse in Paris also announced 
that it would play host to a meeting Nov. 27 of nine other European 
exchanges to discuss ``the steps and conditions needed to create a 
unifying and competitive pan-European equity market.'' The two announcements 
show how the introduction of the currency, the euro, is reshaping 
Europe's financial landscape, requiring Europeans to think in Continental 
rather than national terms in finance and business. And it suggested 
that exchange authorities in Paris, ruffled by the announcement in 
July of a ``strategic alliance'' between the London Stock Exchange 
and the Deutsche Borse in Frankfurt, had not only abandoned an effort 
to set up a rival market but were also seeking to gain the initiative 
by organizing the Nov. 27 gathering. Some doubt remained, however, 
about the timing and technicalities of the French entry into the alliance. 
Foreign Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn said, ``Paris is joining this 
alliance with the creation from January 1999 of a joint company.'' 
However, officials in London and Frankfurt _ who welcomed the idea 
in principle _ declined to say whether the timing and the arrangements 
were as far advanced as Strauss-Kahn implied. ``I'm afraid I can't 
confirm anything like that,'' a spokeswoman at the London Stock Exchange 
said. ``The appearances are well ahead of the reality at this point,'' 
said an American banker, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. 
Not only that, the notion of a Europe-wide exchange raises technical 
questions about the compatibility not just of trading systems but 
also of the regulations governing stock market operations in the countries 
that will use the euro beginning in January. That has led some analysts 
to forecast that a pan-European exchange could not be up and running 
before 2000. ``There are an awful lot of issues to be resolved,'' 
the American banker said. The euro is to be introduced for electronic 
trading of equities, bonds and futures and for intergovernmental transfers. 
Notes and coins _ the pocket money that shoppers and travelers will 
carry _ will be introduced only in 2002. Initially, the currency will 
group 11 European nations in a euro zone, leaving Britain, Denmark, 
Sweden and Greece on the outside. With its concentration of banking 
and trading, however, London is expected to continue as the main market 
center. The prospect has heightened pressure for consolidation among 
exchanges. Stock market officials in Milan, Madrid, Amsterdam and 
Brussels have indicated they would be interested in joining the London-Frankfurt 
alliance, which will initially create a single point of liquidity 
for trading in British and German blue-chip issues. The London exchange 
estimates that a pan-European stock exchange would group together 
companies with a market capitalization of $5.5 trillion, compared 
with $8.7 trillion on the New York Stock Exchange. The Paris Bourse, 
the third largest of the European exchanges and the last major holdout 
toward a pan-European market, said that it had also invited officials 
from exchanges in Zurich and Stockholm to attend the Nov. 27 meeting. 
A spokeswoman said officials from the London Stock Exchange would 
be at the meeting. Also Thursday, the New York Mercantile Exchange 
and the International Petroleum Exchange here acknowledged that they 
were considering a merger that would bring together the two biggest 
energy futures markets. Discussions began in July, and the exchanges 
have formed a working group to study a merger. They already cooperate 
in the development of a system intended to coordinate after-hours 
electronic trading.

Palm Pilot in one hand, cellular phone in the other, Jean-Marc Routiers, 
26, was juggling business calls halfway between London and Paris. 
When his phone went dead as the high-speed Eurostar train pulled into 
the underwater tunnel that links England to the Continent, the London-based 
French banker loosened his Italian silk tie and introduced himself. 
``I definitely describe myself as a European,'' he said in the fluent 
English he perfected working at an Australian bank. ``I may get sentimental 
when they play the Marseillaise, but for all the practical things, 
I see myself as a citizen of Europe. I like the lifestyle in France, 
but I don't make my living there.'' The year 1999 is the official 
start-up date of the euro, the common European currency that will 
unite 11 countries monetarily. But throughout Europe, a different 
kind of integration has already taken root. Routiers, who was spending 
a day in Paris to meet with his bank's French clients, is at the vanguard 
of a new generation of Europeans who do not have to brace themselves 
for a shock in the new year. Mobile, fluent in several languages and 
aggressively non-nationalistic, they are already living the kind of 
borderless, cosmopolitan existence that the single European currency 
is supposed to advance. They do not share their parents' memories 
of World War II or their parents' sense of national identity. ``People 
worry when they hear talk of a common European defense policy because 
it suggests that at the end of the day, we have one government,'' 
said Kleon Papadopoulos, a Greek banker based in London. ``Countries 
are afraid to lose their sovereignty, but I don't see it as a bad 
thing. If a government is good, stable and efficient, who cares if 
it is based in Berlin or Athens?'' Papadopoulos, 36, who studied business 
in the United States and Britain, could serve as a model for the new 
Europeans. He works for a Swiss bank in London, speaks Greek, English 
and French, and in the past year has traveled, among other places, 
to Belgium, the United States, Cuba, Switzerland and Italy. Like hundreds 
of thousands of other Europeans, he chose London _ and its busy financial 
markets _ as the best place to work. He said he does not feel as if 
he lives in England. He lives in London, the clubhouse of financial 
Europe. And membership has its privileges. Papadopoulos lives in the 
fashionable Knightsbridge area, drives a Porsche he bought in Brussels, 
and works out at the fashionable gym of the Carleton Towers. ``I went 
to the London School of Economics in 1984, and the only other `foreigners' 
I met were from the Middle East,'' he says. ``Now friends and co-workers 
are Italian, French, Greek, Spanish, German, even Russian. You feel 
it everywhere. The streets are jammed with foreigners. Not tourists 
_ people who live and work here.'' Baby-boomers in Europe often describe 
themselves as the 1968 generation, weaned on the protest and social 
turmoil that convulsed European societies 30 years ago. Less dramatic 
but equally significant was a 1968 law guaranteeing freedom of movement 
within what were then the six countries of the Common Market. A Frenchman 
could work in Holland, an Italian could work in Germany without a 
permit. Back then some economists dourly predicted huge migrations, 
particularly of unskilled laborers moving from southern countries 
to the more prosperous north. Actually, as huge industries like steel 
shrank in the 1970s and '80s, so did the job opportunities for working-class 
Europeans. There are 15 countries within what is now the European 
Union, but only a small percentage of their citizens have moved to 
other countries, according to estimates prepared by Eurostat. Those 
who do mostly find jobs in the service industry as waiters, maids 
or garbage collectors. There are still legal barriers preventing most 
doctors, lawyers and academics from finding work in other countries. 
So far the European Union has been most profitably put to use by white-collar 
business executives who eagerly followed career opportunities across 
national borders, time zones and language barriers. Twenty-five years 
ago that kind of mobility was the preserve of a far smaller elite, 
the top executives of major companies or multinational corporations. 
Technology, from high-speed trains to the ever-evolving apparatus 
of business _ lap-top computers, cell phones, fax machines _ has made 
European mobility accessible to mid-level managers, young entrepreneurs 
and even students. Cable television, which allows Germans to watch 
Italian game shows or Swedes to watch French news programs, has spread 
the Zeitgeist to the masses. This year Superga, an Italian brand of 
sports clothes and shoes, opened a major advertising campaign with 
a series of magazine ads that show fashionable young people saucily 
cavorting with European leaders _ a leggy young woman pushes her bicycle 
up the steps of the Elysee Palace to greet President Jacques Chirac, 
a young man playfully sticks his tongue out the window of the plane 
of the former German chancellor, Helmut Kohl. ``This kind of ad would 
not have been possible five or 10 years ago,'' said Aldo Cernuto, 
executive creative director of the Milan office of Pirella Gottsche 
Lowe, an international advertising agency. ``Now European unification 
is on the TV all the time; it has seeped into people's unconscious. 
Even people who do not care about politics recognize the faces of 
a Tony Blair or Jacques Chirac. Ten years ago, very few people did.'' 
According to the European Union, Britain has twice as many EU citizens 
as France, but it is not the country with the highest concentration 
of residents from other European countries. According to estimates 
based on surveys prepared by Eurostat, nearly a third of the residents 
of tiny Luxembourg, which has low unemployment and a high standard 
of living, are from other European countries. Belgium, which has the 
European Commission and NATO headquarters, is second, with 5.4 percent. 
Paradoxically, perhaps, Britain, the one major European nation that 
has held off from joining the euro, is widely viewed as the nerve 
center of the new cosmopolitanism, headquarters for the New Europeans 
_ bankers and business executives drawn by London's financial district, 
a more flexible bureaucracy and the universality of the English language. 
Perhaps just as surprisingly, London also serves as an example of 
another less obvious aspect of European cosmopolitanism _ the breakdown 
of certain social barriers. Studying abroad was once a privilege reserved 
to the sons and daughters of Europe's elite. Now the European Union 
has a 12-year-old scholarship program, called Socrates-Erasmus, that 
this year allowed 200,000 European university students _ 5 percent 
of the EU's entire university population _ to study in other countries 
within the Union for up to a year, free. In the last 20 years, business 
schools in Europe have multiplied, and most offer U.S.-style MBA programs 
that teach an American approach to business. This too has allowed 
a measure of meritocracy to creep into European business. ``Juergen 
Schrempp, the head of Daimler, started as a car mechanic,'' noted 
Stephen Szabo, a professor of European Affairs at the Johns Hopkins 
University School for International Studies in Washington. ``That 
would have been unthinkable in Germany 20 years ago.'' Social mobility, 
moreover, is fueled by movement. When people transfer to another country, 
they find it easier to shed the psychological or cultural trappings 
of home. ``I could never have the kind of job I have had I stayed 
in Paris,'' Routier explained. ``France is still very hierarchical. 
Bosses want to know where you went to school, what your father does. 
In London, none of that matters as long as you make money.'' Many 
Britons still view their country as weighed down by heavy class distinctions. 
For example, Tony Smith, 36, editor of several Portuguese magazines 
in Lisbon, seized an opportunity to study in Vienna 14 years ago, 
and never looked back. He has lived all over Europe, and is fluent 
in Portuguese, Spanish, German, French and Serbo-Croatian. His father, 
a car mechanic, had not traveled out of Britain until 1992. Smith 
said he could never have succeeded as well had he stayed home. ``I 
didn't go to public schools or Oxbridge,'' he explained. ``I'm not 
saying its impossible, but it would have been much more difficult 
in England.'' Yet Continental Europeans who flock to London find themselves 
bypassing English society and joining a cosmopolitan world where birth 
and breeding do not matter as much. Ildiko Iliffe, 30, chose to work 
in London to escape the sexism she encountered on the Continent. Mrs. 
Iliffe, who is Hungarian, speaks fluent English, German, French and 
Italian, and met her Canadian husband, Roger Iliffe, 30, while both 
were attending the University of Bocconi business school in Milan 
in 1995. Like his wife, Iliffe speaks four languages and has lived 
and traveled all over the world. She works on the Eastern European 
desk of a British bank; he works for a major international consulting 
firm. Originally they planned to work in Italy, but Mrs. Iliffe said 
the prevailing attitude towards working women there made it impossible 
for her to find as good a job. ``I went to job interviews at Italian 
banks and they only asked me about my husband's job,'' she said with 
a grimace. ``And they made it clear that they were afraid I would 
get pregnant and ask for maternity leave.'' Philippe Haspeslagh, 48, 
a professor at Insead, the prestigious international business school 
in Fontainebleau, outside Paris, called Mrs. Iliffe's choices cherry-picking 
_ choosing the best deal for herself. As he put it, ``If they cannot 
find what they want in one country, they can pick up and seek it elsewhere.'' 
Twenty-five years ago, Haspeslagh was a pioneer when he did the same 
thing. A Belgian who studied business at Harvard, he lives and teaches 
in France and does consulting work all over Europe, from Sweden to 
the Czech Republic. The message on his cell phone is in three languages 
_ French, Flemish and English. His students, a generation behind him, 
see nothing exceptional in his transnationalism. These Europeans form 
an advance guard that is still relatively small in numbers, but experts 
say they carry a disproportionate influence on their societies. ``In 
Germany, for example, it is the business people who are pushing ahead 
with change and pulling politicians along behind them kicking and 
screaming,'' Szabo said. ``They are looking at a larger market and 
feel the competitive pressures of globalization. Politicians are responding 
to a domestic constituency. They are answering to an international 
one.''
