Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi began a surprise visit to neighboring 
Tunisia on Monday, his first known trip since injuring his hip in 
July. Col. Gadhafi, whose country is under a U.N. air embargo, arrived 
by land for ``a visit of brotherhood and rest'' at the invitation 
of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, an official statement said. 
Tunisian television did not show the Libyan leader but said he met 
with Ben Ali and several government ministers in a desert oasis at 
Tozeur, 400 kms (240 miles) south of Tunis, where foreign leaders 
are entertained. Officials, however, did not give the duration or 
full itinerary of Gadhafi's visit. The trip was not announced in advance, 
though Ben Ali extended the invitation to Gadhafi when he visited 
Libya in August. Gadhafi was first driven to Gabes, 365 kms (200 miles) 
south of Tunis, after crossing the border at Ras Jedir where he was 
met by Interior Minister Ali Chaouch, officials said. It was Gadhafi's 
first known trip abroad since he broke a bone near his hip while exercising 
and underwent surgery in July, officials have said. The Libyan leader 
last visited Tunisia in January 1996, when he met Ban Ali in the southern 
town of Medenine. Since 1992, Libya has struggled with U.N. Security 
Council sanctions that ban direct flights to and from the country. 
The move was aimed at forcing Gadhafi to surrender two Libyans wanted 
in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am passenger plane over Lockerbie, Scotland, 
that killed 270 people. The council has agreed to suspend the sanctions 
once Libya turns the men over for a trial by Scottish judges according 
to Scottish law in the Netherlands, under a U.S.-British proposal. 
Gadhafi has offered to hand them over but demands any sentences be 
served in Dutch or Libyan prisons.

Louis Farrakhan, the leader of a U.S. Muslim group, met with Libyan 
leader Moammar Gadhafi on Sunday and congratulated him on his recovery 
from a hip injury, state-run Libyan radio reported. Improved health 
will enable Gadhafi to ``carry on his leading role in the service 
of Islamic causes in the world,'' Farrakhan was quoted as saying by 
the radio, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp. Later, state-run 
television showed Gadhafi _ dressed in a brown robe and holding a 
cane _ meeting Farrakhan at his ceremonial tent in the Libyan capital, 
Tripoli. The broadcast was monitored in Cairo. Gadhafi underwent surgery 
last July after injuring his hip, reportedly while exercising. The 
visit was Farrakhan's fifth to Libya in the past three years. The 
leader of the U.S.-based Nation of Islam most recently visited in 
December 1997. It was not immediately clear how Farrakhan arrived 
in Libya or how long he would stay. Most visitors arrive by ferry 
from Malta or travel overland from Egypt or Tunisia; U.N. sanctions 
imposed in 1992 ban air travel to and from the country. Farrakhan 
repeatedly has urged an end to the sanctions, which were imposed to 
try to force Gadhafi to surrender two Libyans wanted in the 1988 bombing 
of a Pan Am jetliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270 people. 
Citing the sanctions and U.S. regulations, the Treasury Department 
prohibited Farrakhan from accepting a dlrs 250,000 prize he was awarded 
by Gadhafi in September 1996 for human rights work. The Treasury also 
barred his group from accepting Gadhafi's offer of a dlrs 1 billion 
gift for Nation of Islam activities. His Nation of Islam is a black 
nationalist group that says it is guided by the Koran. It is not considered 
a true Muslim sect by others who practice Islam. Farrakhan's message 
to America's black community is one of self-reliance, discipline, 
spirituality and separatism. Over the years, he has said that whites 
and blacks should live separately, that Jews are ``bloodsuckers'' 
who have a ``gutter religion,'' and that whites are ``subhuman.'' 
He accuses news media of taking his comments out of context.

Secretary General Kofi Annan said Wednesday he was extending his North 
African tour to include talks with Libyan authorities. The remark 
was made without elaboration at a news conference in Algiers hours 
before his arrival in Tunis, his final scheduled stop on a tour aimed 
at unblocking plans for a U.N. referendum on the disputed Western 
Sahara. During his visit to Tunis, Annan is to meet with authorities 
here to discuss ``major regional and international issues and the 
various initiatives aimed at solving unresolved problems,'' according 
to the local press. A Western diplomat, speaking in Algiers on condition 
of anonymity, said Annan would travel to Libya on Saturday to meet 
with authorities there on the 1988 Pan Am bombing that has led to 
U.N. sanctions against Libya. Annan's trip to Tunisia is scheduled 
to end Friday, according to the official program. The discrepancy 
in the timing could not be immediately clarified. The U.N. Security 
Council imposed sanctions in 1992, including a flight ban, to try 
to force Libya to hand over two suspects in the bombing that killed 
270 people. The sanctions ban flights to and from the country. Neighboring 
Tunisia provides a land route for those traveling to Libya from the 
region. A week ago, before leaving for North Africa, Annan held out 
the possibility of a Libyan trip -- but only to help close a deal 
to try the two suspects. A Libyan legal team has been meeting regularly 
with Annan's legal counsel to discuss a U.S.-British proposal to try 
the suspects in the Netherlands according to Scottish law and using 
Scottish judges. Annan had said last week that he had hoped for a 
breakthrough in the case by the end of November. He said then that 
a trip to Libya ``to bring the issue finally to closure ... has not 
been excluded.'' During his Algerian stay,

TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan arrived in 
Libya Saturday for talks aimed at bringing to trial two Libyan suspects 
in the 1988 Pan Am bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland. Annan's one-day 
visit to meet with Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi followed reports 
in the Libyan media that Gadhafi had no authority to hand over the 
suspects. This position would indicate that Gadhafi is giving himself 
enough diplomatic room in the event he decides against giving up the 
suspects. Annan flew aboard a special plane from the Tunisian resort 
island of Jerba after receiving a clearance from the U.N. Sanctions 
Committee to make the flight. A Libyan official, speaking on condition 
of anonymity, said Annan had arrived in the country but refused to 
give details. Libyan media, controlled by the government, did not 
report on the visit in a sign that the subject is of great sensitivity. 
It was not known where Annan will meet with Gadhafi but diplomats 
said Friday the meeting will likely take place in the northern coastal 
town of Sirte, 400 kilometers (250 miles) east of the Libyan capital 
of Tripoli. Libya has been under U.N. sanctions since 1992 for its 
refusal to hand over the two alleged intelligence agents, Abdel Basset 
Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah. They are accused by the United 
States and Britain of blowing up a Pan Am airliner over the Scottish 
village of Lockerbie on Dec. 21, 1988. All 259 people aboard the Boeing 
747 and 11 people on ground were killed. A Libyan legal team has been 
meeting regularly with Annan's legal counsel to discuss a U.S.-British 
proposal to try the suspects in the Netherlands according to Scottish 
law and using Scottish judges. Dutch authorities say they have made 
arrangements to hold the trial at Camp Zeist, a former air force base 
near Utrecht. On Friday, Annan said the U.N. team ``has done some 
good work on the Lockerbie dossier.'' ``We will try to resolve some 
problems and to find solutions together _ once and for all,'' Annan 
said. But in an apparent bid to distance the Libyan leader from a 
decision on the suspects, Libya's official news agency JANA said Friday 
that Gadhafi ``is neither president nor prime minister nor foreign 
minister, but only the leader of the Libyan revolution.'' ``As such, 
Col. Gadhafi is not empowered to sign an agreement,'' the report said. 
JANA suggested that a decision on handing over the suspects would 
have to be approved by some 500 grassroots national committees before 
being decided by the Parliament. The Netherlands was chosen as a venue 
for the trial after Libya itself proposed the trial be held in a third 
country. Since then a new hurdle has cropped up over the imprisonment 
of the suspects, if convicted. Libya wants them jailed in the Netherlands 
or Libya, but the United States and Britain say they should be imprisoned 
in Scotland and refuse to negotiate the issue. The U.N. sanctions 
on Libya do not cover oil exports, Libya's economic lifeblood. They 
ban air travel to and from the country and arms sales. Some Libyan 
assets abroad have also been frozen. But many African countries have 
defied the air ban and their leaders have flown in and out of Libya.

After meeting Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi in a desert tent, U.N. 
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said he thinks an arrangement for bringing 
two suspects to trial in the bombing of a Pan Am airliner could be 
secured in the ``not too distant future.'' Annan's comments came Saturday 
after he and Gadhafi failed to agree on handing over Abdel Basset 
Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, who are suspected in the 
1988 bombing that killed 270 people. On Sunday, state-run Libyan Radio 
quoted an unnamed official in the Foreign Liaison Secretariat, which 
is the equivalent of a foreign ministry, as saying that ``a solution 
to this crisis is within reach.'' He credited Annan's talks with Omar 
al-Muntasser, Libya's foreign minister, who met with Annan in Sirte 
before Annan went on to talks with Gadhafi. Sirte is 400 kilometers 
(250 miles) east of the Libyan capital Tripoli. The official spoke 
of ``fruitful talks'' but gave no details. The broadcast was monitored 
by the British Broadcasting Corp. Also Sunday, British Foreign Secretary 
Robin Cook said in an interview with the BBC that he had spoken with 
Annan on Sunday and was ``very encouraged by what he tells me.'' He 
added: ``I think you could sum up our mood as one of qualified optimism.'' 
Britain would like to see the two suspects in custody by Dec. 21, 
the 10th anniversary of the Pan Am bombing. But Cook said Britain 
will not budge on the demand by Washington and London that the suspects 
serve any sentence in a Scottish jail. Libya has asked that any prison 
terms be served in the Netherlands or Libya. Annan spoke to reporters 
in Tripoli after the meeting with Gadhafi and later when he arrived 
back at this Tunisian island, where he had begun the day of diplomacy 
that lasted nearly 15 hours. The 60-year-old Annan is trying to get 
Libya to go along with a U.S.-British plan to try the two suspects 
before a panel of Scottish judges in the Netherlands for the 1988 
bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland. ``The talks have been fruitful and 
positive,'' Annan said in Tripoli. ``Libya has confirmed its seriousness 
and readiness to find a solution to the Lockerbie problem. ``Libya 
has also agreed to a trial in a third country and believes that it 
ought to be possible to find answers to all other outstanding issues,'' 
he said. ``So I hope that in the not too distant future we will be 
able to give the families good news,'' he added, referring to the 
relatives of victims who have lobbied extensively for a trial. Annan 
left Jerba on Sunday for the United Arab Emirates, where he will attend 
a summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council, a federation of six Arab 
Gulf states. In Washington, James Foley, a State Department spokesman, 
said the United States is awaiting a briefing from Annan but is ``disappointed'' 
that Libya has not complied with U.N. Security Council resolutions. 
``Compliance means turnover of the two suspects for trial,'' Foley 
said. ``It's been almost 10 years since the Pan Am 103 tragedy, this 
has gone on for far too long.'' The meeting with Gadhafi took place 
after Libya's official news agency, JANA, reported that Annan might 
not be able to meet with the Libyan leader because Gadhafi was ``in 
the desert.'' U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said Annan was taken on 
an hour's trip into the desert in a four-wheel drive vehicle to meet 
with Gadhafi in a tent with a roaring fire outside. Earlier, Libyan 
media suggested that Gadhafi had no authority to hand over the suspects 
_ an indication he was giving himself room in case he decides against 
giving up the two men wanted by the United States and Britain. JANA 
indicated a decision on handing over the two suspects would have to 
be approved by some 500 grassroots national committees before being 
considered by the Parliament. Libyan radio reported that the Parliament 
had been called to meet Tuesday in Sirte but did not say whether the 
Lockerbie issue would be discussed. Annan flew into Libya aboard a 
special plane from Jerba after receiving clearance from the U.N. Sanctions 
Committee. Libya has been under U.N. sanctions since 1992 for its

The U.N. sanctions ban air travel in and out of the country but do 
not cover oil exports, Libya's economic lifeblood. The Netherlands 
was chosen as a venue after Libya proposed a trial in a neutral country. 
But a disagreement has arisen because Libya wants the suspects jailed 
in the Netherlands or Libya if convicted, but the United States and 
Britain insist they be imprisoned in Scotland. 
 APW19981209.1444 
Libya's justice minister on Wednesday said the two suspects in the 
1988 bombing of a Pan Am jetliner should not become victims of Western 
politics when they go on trial. ``We want to be sure that the only 
aim of the trial is to show the truth ... and that it is held without 
a political or security background,'' Justice Minister Mohammed Belgasim 
al-Zuwiy said. He was addressing the General People's Congress, or 
Parliament, which opened a debate that will decide the fate of the 
two men who are wanted in connection with the Dec. 21, 1988 bombing. 
A total of 270 people on board and on ground were killed when the 
jetliner blew up over the Scottish town of Lockerbie. Libya has accepted 
in principle to a trial before a panel of Scottish judges in the Netherlands. 
But the hand over of the suspects has been held up over Libya's demand 
for a guarantee that the two men, if convicted, will be jailed in 
Libya. The United States and Britain insist that the two suspects 
serve their prison term in Britain. The Parliament meeting, expected 
to last five days, is being held in the northern coastal town of Sirte 
and was broadcast live on national television. Libyan media have suggested 
that Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi does not have the authority to 
hand over the suspects and that any decision would have to be approved 
by the Congress. ``Our argument is that since this is an exceptional 
trial, therefore this exception should include serving the jail term 
in Libya, maybe under U.N. supervision,'' al-Zuwiy said. He said Libya 
is seeking the guarantees from the West to ensure that the trial will 
be ``honest, just .. and without loopholes that (would) leave our 
citizens in illegal, unjust and inappropriate circumstances.'' Opening 
the debate, Foreign Minister Omar al-Muntasser gave the background 
to the controversy since the Security Council imposed sanctions on 
Libya in 1992 to force it to hand over the Lockerbie suspects for 
trial. The sanctions include a ban on air travel from and to Libya, 
restricting diplomatic personnel and banning the purchase of oil equipment. 
Al-Zuwiy, the justice minister, said the two suspects will have the 
right to an appeal in the same court if it finds them guilty. On Saturday, 
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan met with Gadhafi to iron out the 
details. No agreement was reached but Annan said Libya is expected 
to reach a decision soon.

Qatar's foreign minister, Sheik Hamad bin Jassem bin Jaber Al Thani, 
met Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi in the desert on Saturday, Libya's 
official television reported. The television, monitored in Cairo, 
did not say where the meeting took place, but it showed Gadhafi, dressed 
in a muddy brown gown and matching cap, receiving the Qatari minister 
in a tent. Al Thani handed Gadhafi a letter that reaffirmed Qatar's 
support for Libya ``in its just position toward the so-called Lockerbie 
case,'' the television said, referring to Libya's objections to the 
U.N. sanctions imposed in 1992 to press it to hand over two Libyans 
wanted for the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am airliner over the Scottish 
town of Lockerbie that left 270 people dead. The television gave no 
other details about the visit.

With the mournful lament of bagpipes and prayers of healing, the people 
of Lockerbie paid tribute to the 270 people killed when a bomb brought 
Pan Am Flight 103 crashing down on this tiny town 10 years ago Monday. 
The hundreds who packed Dryfesdale Parish Church heard messages from 
British Prime Minister Tony Blair and U.S. President Bill Clinton, 
who renewed their vows to punish the culprits who hid the bomb in 
a suitcase on Dec. 21, 1988. But they also heard quiet sobs that echoed 
throughout the century-old church as a few moments of silence were 
observed before the bagpiper blew her lament. ``In the lives that 
were lost, some very young, there was meaning and achievement,'' the 
Rev. David Almond told the gathering of about 600 people, which included 
60 family members of those who perished. ``Our task in commemoration 
is to continue that meaning and to build on that achievement.'' The 
congregation heard the children of the local elementary school sing 
a tribute, ``Let There be Love,'' as well as a message from the queen. 
``We pray on this anniversary that the families will find solace together 
in quiet remembrance across the world,'' the queen's message said. 
In a separate service in London's Westminster Abbey, attended by Blair, 
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook and Prince Andrew, the second son of 
Queen Elizabeth II, hundreds listened as one-by-one the names of the 
259 passengers and 11 of Lockerbie's own residents were read out as 
a candle was lit for each. Simultaneous services were also held at 
Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia and in Syracuse, New York, 
which lost 35 college students in the crash. Each service began at 
7:03 p.m. (1903 GMT), the moment when the plane disappeared from the 
radar screen above Scotland. ``This was a very positive, emotional 
day,'' Bert Ammerman of River Vale, New Jersey, whose brother Thomas 
died in the crash, said after the service. He said the people of Lockerbie 
have ``proven over the past 10 years that good intentions can overcome 
evil.'' Earlier in the day, Prince Philip, the queen's husband, laid 
a wreath in Lockerbie's cemetery, where the town's Roman Catholic 
parish priest at the time of the crash spoke to about 200 victims' 
relatives and townspeople about the ``ticking bomb'' of justice. ``Ten 
years ago, for you and for us, a bomb was ticking,'' the Rev. Pat 
Keegans told the crowd, many of them visibly moved. ``Be assured of 
this _ there is another bomb ticking _ the irresistible bomb of justice 
and truth. ``Be certain that our wreath-laying today is not a symbolic 
gesture. It is a declaration that we will not rest until we have justice 
and truth, until all who are responsible for your deaths are held 
accountable,'' he said. Two Libyan suspects have been indicted in 
connection with the bombing, but have not yet been turned over for 
trial. Last week, Libya's Parliament gave its conditional approval 
for a trial in the Netherlands by a Scottish court, but said some 
obstacles remained. The plane had just reached its cruising altitude 
of 31,000 feet (9,400 kms), 42 minutes after taking off from London's 
Heathrow Airport for New York, when it exploded in the night sky. 
The aircraft was felled by a small amount of high explosives smuggled 
on in a portable radio hidden inside a suitcase, which made its way 
as checked baggage from Malta to Frankfurt, Germany, and then to London.
