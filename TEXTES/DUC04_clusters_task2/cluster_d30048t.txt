Latin American leaders flew Friday to Portugal for a weekend summit 
to figure out how they can shield their economies from the global 
financial crisis. Not since the early 1980s have so many countries 
been in recession, and the crisis now threatens to cripple Latin America's 
developing economies. An early arrival, Cuban President Fidel Castro, 
described the turmoil in world financial markets as the most important 
issue facing the world at the moment. ``I don't know if we are coming 
to the end of the world economic order. It will be interesting to 
know,'' the Cuban leader said at a hotel press conference shortly 
after his arrival for the annual Ibero-American summit. Emphasizing 
the scale of the threat, Castro said President Clinton was aware that 
``if South America falls into crisis, it will be extended inevitably 
also to the United States,'' which is heavily involved in investments 
and loans in the region. Jittery investors have abruptly pulled cash 
out of Latin America with devastating effects on stock markets and 
currency reserves. The heads of state and government from Latin America, 
Spain and Portugal will explore measures to ward off the financial 
turmoil that already has devastated Asia and Russia. Stock markets 
also fell in Portugal and Spain, heavy investors in Latin America. 
The Latin American leaders must gauge the need for unpopular reforms 
of their public finances, including austerity packages which risk 
social unrest and political upheaval. A joint declaration will be 
signed Sunday in this ancient port city on the Douro River in northern 
Portugal. Diplomats said there was consensus on the form of the final 
statement. The declaration ``calls on the international community, 
and Group of Seven countries in particular, to take the necessary 
measures to promote stability in international financial markets, 
which is a necessary condition for sustained economic growth,'' said 
Luis Augusto Castro Neves, of the Brazilian Foreign Ministry. Latin 
America's leaders favor creating some kind of regulatory system for 
global financial transactions that would place controls on speculators, 
like measures to slow down the internatioal flow of money. They also 
want reforms that allow international financial institutions to head 
off crises rather than react to them with rescue packages. ``International 
institutions must be active in tackling crises like the recent one 
... and contribute to stability,'' Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime 
Gama said. ``Countries that have progressive policies should not be 
penalized, they should be given incentives,'' Gama added in reference 
to Latin American nations' efforts to modernize their economies. Brazil, 
the continent's largest economy and a potential bulwark against creeping 
recession, is waiting for news of a dlrs 30 billion bailout package 
from the International Monetary Fund. The presidents of the World 
Bank and InterAmerican Development Bank also were expected at the 
talks. The move by the U.S. Federal Reserve to cut interest rates 
Thursday revived Latin America's financial markets, but analysts expected 
the reprieve to be short-lived because of deep concerns about the 
continent's economic health. The recent economic troubles stemmed 
in part from the structural weaknesses of Latin American economies. 
A strike being waged by state employees in Colombia against a government 
austerity package offers a glimpse of the trouble that could arise 
if tough reforms are introduced. Brazil is drafting an austerity package 
that will hit public spending, especially social security.

Leaders from 19 Latin American nations, Spain and Portugal put finishing 
touches Saturday on an Ibero-American summit declaration warning of 
global recession unless action is taken to stabilize the international 
financial system. The draft declaration said recent financial market 
turmoil shows that adjustments must be made quickly ``to keep the 
difficulties affecting a few from becoming a crisis for all.'' The 
declaration addresses the world's seven richest nations. The Group 
of Seven is composed of the United States, Japan, Britain, Germany, 
France, Italy and Canada. The final declaration will be approved at 
Sunday's summit in this port city in northern Portugal. Brazilian 
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso said Saturday that Brazil and 
China, two of the world's largest economies, had become the ``dikes 
of resistance'' to global recession. Protecting their economies from 
the spreading economic turmoil, which is affecting more countries 
than at any time since the early 1980s, is key to world economic stability, 
he said. Brazil is Latin America's biggest economy and the eighth-largest 
in the world, and its economic collapse could take the rest of the 
continent with it. To halt Brazil's slide toward recession, Cardoso 
is preparing austerity measures including spending cuts, tax hikes 
and lower interest rates. The reforms would help Brazil qualify for 
an International Monetary Fund rescue package estimated at dlrs 30 
billion. The IMF has put together bailout packages totaling dlrs 137 
billion since the financial crisis struck Thailand 15 months ago and 
then spread from Asia to Russia. U.S. President Bill Clinton's administration, 
aware of the impact that a Latin American recession would have on 
the United States, has actively pushed the IMF and the World Bank 
to support Brazil after it was hit by investor flight.

Caught in the middle of an economic crisis, many Brazilian factories 
fear they won't be able to pay their workers the mandatory year-end 
bonus. So they're considering paying with products instead of cash. 
Some workplaces have already offered their employees such things as 
hammers, nails, screws and bolts instead of the traditional cash bonus 
that normally is equivalent to one month's wage, said the head of 
Brazil's largest federation of trade unions. ``The idea is completely 
unacceptable,'' said Joao Antonio Felicio, secretary-general of the 
federation, which represents more than 2,000 unions and 19 million 
workers. ``We will recommend our unions reject such a preposterous 
proposal.'' But strapped for cash and punished by high interest rates 
and declining sales, factory owners may have no other choice, said 
Joseph Curi, president of the Sao Paulo State Association of Small 
Industries, which represents 110,000 factories that employ nearly 
800,000 workers. ``Access to credit is almost impossible,'' Curi said. 
``If banks and the government don't create some kind of emergency 
credit line, the only option many of our associates will have will 
be to use products to pay the bonus.'' Factories that produce clothes, 
shoes, food, toys and household appliances were ``the most enthusiastic 
about the idea,'' Curi said. Curi predicted even harsher times for 
Brazil with the belt-tightening austerity package newly re-elected 
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso is expected to announce Tuesday. 
The measures, aimed at curbing the country's ballooning budget deficit 
_ equal to about 7 percent of gross domestic product _ are expected 
to include spending cuts and, possibly, more taxes. ``There is a lot 
of talk of increasing taxes, which means less cash circulating in 
the market and more credit restrictions,'' Curi said. ``It is a shortsighted 
approach that will spell more recession and the collapse of many small 
factories.'' Brazil has been a major casualty of the global economic 
crisis, buffeted by loss of investor confidence and a strong outflow 
of capital. The country's foreign reserves have fallen below dlrs 
50 billion, from dlrs 70 billion at the end of July. In an effort 
to prevent a collapse of the nation's currency, the real, and stem 
capital flight, interest rates were hiked to 50 percent a year. For 
union leader Felicio, the proposed product-for-cash swap ``is a clear 
sign of the despair the business sector is feeling because of the 
recessive economic policies'' brought by the Real Plan, the economic 
stabilization program put together in 1994 when Cardoso was finance 
minister. The plan succeeded in slashing inflation from 2,400 percent 
to almost zero today. But it also brought recession and unemployment, 
which now stands at almost 8 percent, the highest in a decade.

Brazil and the International Monetary Fund moved closer Tuesday to 
agreement on an expected dlrs 30 billion rescue package for the world's 
ninth-largest economy. A joint statement by the IMF and the Brazilian 
government said the two sides agreed Brazil should aim to reduce its 
budget deficit from an expected eight percent of gross domestic product 
to zero by 2000. The statement was issued after weekend talks between 
IMF officials and a Brazilian delegation headed by Pedro Parente, 
executive secretary of the Finance Ministry. Representatives of the 
World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank took part in the 
talks. Both organizations as well as private banks are expected to 
contribute to the rescue package. Brazil is the latest country to 
be hit by the financial crisis that began 15 months ago in Asia and 
then spread to Russia. Brazil has lost about dlrs 25 billion in foreign 
currency reserves since August when Russia defaulted on its debts 
and sparked a new crisis of confidence in emerging market countries. 
If instability continues in Brazil it could affect Argentina, its 
main trading partner, and other Latin American economies. Despite 
the re-election of Fernando Henrique Cardoso for a second term as 
president and the announcement Oct. 8 that Brazil and the IMF had 
agreed on the broad outlines of a financial assistance package, investors 
continued to withdraw large sums of money from Brazil. Cardoso is 
preparing an emergency program of budget cuts to restore investor 
confidence and prevent a devaluation of the country's currency. Investors 
want Cardoso to outline the plans this week but he is expected to 
wait until after Sunday's second round of elections for state governors, 
whose support he needs for his budget cuts. The joint statement said 
the Brazil-IMF discussions ``were aimed at preparing the ground for 
prompt support by the international community, including the IMF, 
for the multi-year fiscal program to be announced soon by the Brazilian 
authorities, which will include new policy initiatives.'' The statement 
reiterated Brazil's goal of achieving a primary budget surplus of 
2.6 percent of its gross domestic product in 1999, 2.8 percent in 
2000 and 3.0 percent in 2001 which would '' fulfill the government 
target of stabilizing the ratio of net consolidated public sector 
debt to GDP by the year 2000.'' The two sides are to continue their 
talks ``with the objective of reaching early agreement,'' the statement 
said.

There's no such thing as a free lunch any longer in Brazil, President 
Fernando Henrique Cardoso is telling government workers. No haircuts 
or phone calls, either. Eager to bolster the sagging economy, Cardoso 
wants to slash dlrs 19 billion from the budget deficit, and he's beginning 
by paring perks for the more than 2,000 workers at the presidential 
palace in Brasilia, the capital. Sure, it's not much when compared 
with a deficit of some dlrs 65 billion, or 7 percent of economic output. 
But as Cardoso readies a package of spending cuts and tax increases, 
he clearly wants to show Brazilians that economy starts at home. So 
goodbye to the afternoon courtesy snack of sandwiches, fruit and juice, 
a palace tradition. Three barber shops in the palace were closed, 
and the use of cellular phones and copiers was restricted. The price 
of a buffet offered employees for lunch was raised from dlrs 6 to 
dlrs 8.50. Cardoso himself has promised to travel less and more cheaply. 
On a trip to a summit in Portugal this month, he took a delegation 
of just eight, half the usual number. The savings at the palace could 
come to nearly dlrs 145,000 a month, said Nilson Rebello, chief administrator 
of the president's office. Cardoso, under pressure to repair an economy 
battered by the world financial turmoil, is expected to unveil the 
full scope of his deficit-cutting plan next week. It is believed to 
include a spate of new taxes on fuel, income, personal fortunes and 
bank transactions. The plan is part of a deal with the International 
Monetary Fund for a rescue package estimated at dlrs 30 billion. The 
money would strengthen and, hopefully, restore investor confidence 
in the world's ninth-largest economy, now at the center of the financial 
crisis buffeting developing nations for more than a year. Brazil already 
has agreed to annual targets to sharply reduce its deficit through 
the year 2001. On Wednesday, newspapers published a joint statement 
from Brazil and the IMF, although a final agreement hasn't been reached 
yet. Despite Cardoso's efforts, many Brazilians were less than impressed 
by the palace penny-pinching. The leftist Workers Party said the government 
was making a big deal of insignificant savings while it failed to 
cut other dubious projects, such as a dlrs 800,000 moat being built 
around Congress to keep protesters from easily entering the building. 
The Globo TV network also suggested there still was plenty of fat 
to cut, citing government expenses for running shoes, Persian carpets 
and gold cufflinks, intended as presents for visiting dignitaries. 
Cardoso is counting on help from friendly state governors to control 
spending. But the governors, some facing runoff elections on Sunday, 
are promising pay raises and public works projects that could sink 
the austerity plan. In Brasilia, Joaquim Roriz has promised civil 
service raises, bonuses and new jobs that his opponent estimates would 
cost some dlrs 1 billion. Roriz hasn't explained where the money would 
come from. In powerful Minas Gerais state, the government will almost 
certainly have to lay off workers _ the state payroll consumes 78 
percent of the budget. To rein in the free-spending habits of provincial 
politicians, Cardoso reportedly wants to hold local governments to 
bimonthly limits on spending. Federal money would automatically be 
cut off if spending gets out of hand.

President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's efforts to repair the largest 
economy in Latin America may depend on the outcome of this weekend's 
gubernatorial elections. Cardoso wants to impose tough measures that 
would slash government spending and impose new taxes to try to halt 
the slide in Brazil's economy and restore investor confidence. But 
his plan, expected to be unveiled next week, must be approved by Congress, 
and state governors have enormous sway over local delegations. ``The 
influence governors have on their congressional blocs is overwhelming,'' 
said University of Sao Paulo political scientist Eduardo Kugelmas. 
Brazil has been caught up in the financial turmoil that began more 
than a year ago in Southeast Asia. As wary investors have fled its 
financial markets, Brazil's foreign reserves have fallen below dlrs 
50 billion from dlrs 70 billion at the end of July. On Sunday, voters 
return to the polls for runoff elections in 12 states and in the Federal 
District of Brasilia. The outcome will likely determine how successful 
Cardoso is in getting Congress to approve his economic program, which 
is aimed at trimming the budget deficit. New income, fuel and bank 
transaction taxes are expected to be proposed. Kugelmas said opponents 
of the president stand a good chance of winning in four large states 
_ Sao Paulo, Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro and Rio Grande do Sul. ``If 
they win, the president will face a tough uphill battle,'' he said. 
Cardoso needs the governors' support not only in influencing the congressional 
delegations, but also in holding down their own spending. ``The problem 
is that none of the candidates in Sunday's elections ... wants to 
be identified with unpopular austerity measures,'' said Kugelmas. 
``So they promise to spend more money on schools, hospitals and public 
work projects.'' Sao Paulo, Brazil's industrial and financial powerhouse, 
is perhaps the state most critical to the success of Cardoso's austerity 
plans. With more than 34 million inhabitants, nearly equal to the 
entire population of neighboring Argentina, it alone accounts for 
more than one-third of Brazil's economic output and 70 of the 513 
congressional seats. While incumbent governor Mario Covas, a Cardoso 
ally who is seeking re-election, has committed himself to the austerity 
plan, Covas opponent Paulo Maluf is a question mark. ``If Maluf wins, 
he will use his victory as a launching pad to the presidency in 2003,'' 
Kugelmas predicted. ``And that means he will try to stay as far away 
as possible from any austerity measure.''

The Commerce Department on Tuesday provided a concrete measure of 
the effects of the global economic downturn on the American economy, 
reporting that the nation's trade deficit widened by $2.2 billion 
in August to $16.77 billion. That is the widest gap since the government 
recalculated the way it measures trade flows in 1992. It resulted 
from a decline in American exports and a sharp increase in what this 
country buys from abroad. So far this year, the trade deficit is running 
roughly 50 percent above last year's levels and is up to a projected 
$170 billion for the year, a gap that is expected to widen even further. 
One senior administration official who deals with economic issues, 
speaking on condition of anonymity, said Tuesday that internal projections 
suggest that the trade deficit in 1999 could reach $300 billion, a 
figure that he said ``will certainly cut into growth, and could well 
become a major political problem.'' Trade deficits carry with them 
both good and troubling signals about the economy. The current flood 
of imports is helping contain inflation to some of the lowest levels 
in decades. And while sales of American aircraft, computer chips and 
other goods are suffering, the weakening of the dollar on world markets 
in recent weeks may provide an end-of-the-year boost for American 
exporters. But at this moment of global upheaval, the biggest problem 
facing American companies is the inability of many nations and some 
large companies in Asia and Latin America simply to borrow money to 
make ordinary purchases. The result is such a freeze of economic activity 
that empty shipping containers are stacking up on American piers. 
And the effects are hurting everyone from Midwest farmers who can 
no longer send wheat to an impoverished Russia, to East Coast fishermen 
who are discovering that Japan's appetite for salmon and lobster has 
been ruined by the banking crisis. Among the most surprising elements 
of Tuesday's report is that more than a third of August's deficit 
was with one country that so far has managed to ward off the worst 
effects of the global troubles: China. Despite continued growth of 
the Chinese economy, exports to China have slowed dramatically and 
imports of Chinese-made goods have exploded, as the country desperately 
seeks to sell here goods that would ordinarily be sold elsewhere in 
Asia. That increased the monthly deficit with Beijing to $5.9 billion, 
levels previously only seen in trade with Japan. The Chinese _ besieged 
by floods, deeply troubled state-owned industries and an incipient 
banking crisis _ have signaled to the United States in recent weeks 
that they have little interest in any swift moves to open their markets 
further in return for entry into the World Trade Organization. That 
amounts to a major setback for President Clinton, who for three years 
has been using the negotiations over China's entry to the world body 
as the centerpiece of his effort to open China both economically and 
politically. Ostensible progress in this area has been cited by the 
administration until recently as one of the successes of the administration's 
China policy, but now officials say privately that the progress is 
evaporating. The decline in exports will trim the growth of the American 
economy, and it was one factor in the Federal Reserve's decision to 
lower interest rates two times in recent weeks. So administration 
officials were going out of their way Tuesday to portray the numbers 
as another warning sign, but not a crisis. ``While the United States 
remains strong and sound, the troubled condition of the global marketplace 
continue to strongly influence the U.S. trade balance,'' Commerce 
Secretary Williams Daley said in a statement Tuesday. After China, 
the biggest deterioration in the American trade balance in August 
came in Mexico, where the peso has weakened markedly as economic contagion 
has spread through Latin America. Exports to Mexico have remained 
unchanged. But imports from Mexico have increased markedly _ chiefly 
automobiles and automotive parts and telecommunications equipment 
_ as American manufacturers have taken advantage of the weakening 
currency. In contrast, America's trade surplus with Brazil, the latest 
focus of concern by the administration and the International Monetary 
Fund, barely budged from the same period a year ago. Normally, that 
would be cited as a sign of continued demand for American products 
in Latin America's largest economy, but there is fear it might be 
imperiled. The news comes as the United States and the IMF complete 
a bailout package of $30 billion or more for Brazil, intended to help 
it stave off the kind of economic troubles that have swept through 
Asia, Russia and several other nations. Tuesday the IMF and Brazil 
reached agreement on the country's fiscal targets for this year and 
next, a sign that the aid will likely be announced after elections 
in Brazil this weekend. But for all these potential problems, the 
rising trade deficit has barely caused a ripple on Capitol Hill. Because 
the rising level of imports does not appear to be triggering any unemployment 
here, the subject has barely come up in races for the House and Senate 
around the country. The only exception has been in regions where the 
steel industry is strong. The major steel companies have charged in 
recent weeks that Asian nations are dumping products on the American 
market at prices well below their costs. The Commerce Department has 
begun an inquiry. The Commerce Department's numbers showed that the 
deficit rose 15.3 percent to $16.77 billion in August, up from a revised 
figure of $14.55 billion in July. The department said that the resumption 
of production at General Motors Corp. after last summer's strike may 
have increased the size of the deficit's rise in August, as GM brought 
in parts from abroad. The deficit was the highest since the Commerce 
Department began a new method of tracking trade information in 1992. 
Exports, the department said, fell three tenths of 1 percent, to about 
$74.8 billion. Imports rose 2.2 percent to $91.6 billion.

Brazilian officials ended four days of meetings with representatives 
of the International Monetary Fund on Tuesday without living up to 
their public pledge to announce concrete measures to reduce government 
deficits. In Washington, Pedro Parente, executive secretary of the 
Brazilian Finance Ministry, offered only details on Brazil's plans 
for raising a primary account surplus over the next three years. With 
only five days to go before gubernatorial runoffs on Sunday, neither 
he nor President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, in Brasilia, said how 
the government planned to achieve the savings. Important allies of 
Cardoso are lagging behind in three key states, and despite the government 
promises, market analysts did not expect an announcement until after 
the elections. Instead, the strategy in Brasilia and Washington appeared 
to focus on reassuring the markets that work on cutting the deficit 
was going forward, without providing fodder for opponents in domestic 
elections. ``The discussions continue with the objective of reaching 
agreement soon on the detailed program,'' said a joint statement by 
the IMF and the Brazilian Finance Ministry. Because of Brazil's enormous 
deficits, the collapse of emerging markets has hit the nation particularly 
hard, draining foreign currency reserves and pushing the economy toward 
recession. Finance officials in Washington and around the world fear 
that a collapse of Brazil, because of its size and links to other 
economies, would worsen financial instability throughout the hemisphere. 
With 160 million people, Brazil represents the world's ninth-largest 
economy and is the financial engine of Latin America. Throughout the 
day, government officials met with Cardoso in Brasilia and were expected 
to fine-tune a three-year austerity package that Cardoso was to discuss 
with congressional party leaders on Wednesday morning. In Brasilia, 
officials said that among the measures being considered were a tax 
increase on financial transactions, to three-tenths of a percent from 
two-tenths of a percent, and extending the Fiscal Stabilization Fund, 
which sets aside 20 percent of all taxes collected for presidential 
discretionary spending. The fund was to have expired by 1999. Speaking 
in Washington, Parente said that Brazil would aim toward a surplus 
of 2.6 percent in 1999, 2.8 percent in 2000 and 3 percent in 2001. 
It had already been announced, at the end of the IMF's annual meeting 
in Washington two weeks ago that Brazil would have to reach a primary 
account surplus of 2.5 percent to 3 percent to qualify for IMF aid. 
The primary account covers government expenses, without interest payments 
on debt. Ernest Brown, senior economist for Latin America at Morgan 
Stanley Dean Witter, said signs that the Brazilian government and 
the IMF were moving closer to an aid package were reassuring, and 
that he did not expect much more than reassurance until next week. 
``I call this the `We have a pope' scenario,'' Brown said. ``You're 
just going to hear that we have a pope, maybe see the white smoke 
rising,'' he said, ``and not figure out who the pope is until after 
the elections.''

The United States is preparing to commit U.S. taxpayer funds as part 
of a lending program of at least $30 billion to try to insulate Brazil, 
and with it the rest of Latin America, from the worst effects of the 
financial turmoil circling the globe, according to U.S. and foreign 
officials assembling the program. Details of the U.S. contribution, 
which is expected to total several billion dollars in direct aid or 
loan guarantees, have yet to be negotiated. But several congressional 
leaders have been alerted to the likelihood that the administration 
would have to act while Congress is in recess. This early warning 
from the administration reflects memories of how Congress erupted 
with objections and hearings in 1995 when President Clinton committed 
$20 billion in U.S. funds to the bailout of Mexico. But administration 
officials said last week that their early soundings indicate that 
members of Congress are deeply concerned about preventing an economic 
collapse in Latin America that would resound in the United States, 
and thus they expect few objections. The timing of an aid package 
for Brazil _ originally expected within the next few days _ is complicated 
by unexpected delays that have cropped up in dealing with the Brazilian 
government. The government of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso 
faces politically risky gubernatorial elections on Sunday, which may 
well determine whether Brazil can execute an austerity program that 
is the key condition for the loans it is concurrently negotiating 
with the International Monetary Fund. The biggest role in the rescue 
program for Brazil will be taken by the International Monetary Fund, 
which said last week that it would contribute at least $15 billion 
_ and appears to be under pressure from the United States to do even 
more. Another $9 billion or so will come from the World Bank and the 
Inter-American Development Bank, and the remainder from the United 
States and other major industrial nations. Germany and Japan, though, 
have been reluctant to take part, one U.S. official noted, suggesting 
that Latin America is chiefly Washington's problem, not their own. 
So far, U.S. officials working behind the scenes to organize the aid 
package have said nothing in public about the details of plans for 
a direct contribution to Brazil. ``Brazil is very important to the 
economic well-being of the region, the United States and the international 
community, and all of us are very much focused on seeing how we can 
be helpful,'' Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said on Friday. But 
in a wide-ranging interview about the global economic turmoil, Rubin 
declined to say what strategy he would pursue in dealing with Brazil's 
problems and insisted that no decisions had been made about how the 
United States might contribute. But he discussed Brazil as an opportunity 
to engage in the kind of preventive financial diplomacy that President 
Clinton advocated in speeches to the IMF and the World Bank here three 
weeks ago. At the time, Clinton argued that the monetary fund should 
``provide contingent finance to help countries ward off global financial 
contagion'' rather than wait for disaster to strike. Direct U.S. aid 
to Brazil would clearly send a symbolic message: that after a year 
of trying to manage the financial crisis through the monetary fund, 
the United States is now ready to put a limited amount of its own 
capital at risk to prevent further havoc _ not only for Brazil but 
to stop chaos spreading to Argentina, Mexico and other countries that 
are major U.S. trading partners. That would be a change of strategy. 
So far, the United States has operated almost entirely through international 
financial institutions, chiefly the IMF But it would also be a risky 
move for President Clinton, economically and politically. Even though 
Congress objected to the $20 billion in U.S. funds committed to the 
bailout of Mexico, it turned out that only $12 billion was ultimately 
needed, and it has since been paid back, with interest. But Rubin 
noted on Friday that ``it's a very different environment now.'' Other 
administration officials say they believe that there would be few 
objections in Congress to direct U.S. participation in a Brazil bailout. 
``I think there are a lot more people in Congress who are now scared 
to death by what's been happening in the markets, and what could happen 
in their own districts,'' a White House official said last week, ``and 
they won't say much as long as they don't have to vote on it.'' By 
acting soon to stabilize Latin America, the administration is hoping 
to capitalize on two weeks of relative calm after the late-summer 
panic that engulfed Russia and, at its height, led to an outflow of 
a billion dollars a day from Brazil, for fear that it would be the 
next country forced to devalue its currency. Whether this calm marks 
the beginning of a turnaround or just another pause in the wildfires 
that have erupted since Thailand's currency crisis in July 1997 is 
a matter of considerable debate. But many experts cite the confluence 
of several events that have reassured jittery investors around the 
world: two successive interest-rate cuts in the United States, Japan's 
long-delayed move to prop up its banking system with $500 billion 
in taxpayer funds, and a steady strengthening of currencies in Thailand, 
Indonesia and South Korea, the first signs that investors may be preparing 
to return. Always circumspect when it comes to commenting publicly 
on markets, Rubin acknowledged that ``in the last several weeks there 
have been a number of significant, positive developments.'' But the 
former trader, burned during a 26-year career by many false market 
rallies, warned that ``serious issues remain'' and that ``it will 
take some time for the world to work its way out'' of what he has 
repeatedly called ``the most serious international financial disruption 
of the last 50 years.'' In fact, Rubin's aides are clearly nervous 
about the possibility of another outbreak that could set off a new 
round of panic, which has made it virtually impossible for many emerging-market 
countries to borrow money on world markets. ``Brazil and Japan are 
the two obvious tinderboxes,'' said Jeffrey Garten, dean of the Yale 
School of Management, who served as undersecretary of commerce for 
international affairs during Clinton's first term. ``In Brazil, the 
issue is whether the package that is coming together will really be 
big enough to deal with an exploding debt problem. And in Japan the 
question is whether there is real reform that goes along with the 
money.'' But after spending 18 months in negotiations with the Japanese, 
Rubin clearly senses that the United States has little leverage in 
Tokyo; its problems are chiefly rooted in political gridlock, not 
lack of resources. In Brazil, though, the United States has a better 
chance of buying time and influencing an economic reform program, 
as long as it does not appear to be dictating terms publicly to Cardoso 
and his team. But demonstrating economic support will probably require 
tapping the Exchange Stabilization Fund, created during the Roosevelt 
administration to help stabilize the dollar. The money is under Rubin's 
control, with presidential approval, and he reached into it to circumvent 
congressional objections to aiding Mexico in 1995. But the reaction 
was so strong _ for a time Congress restricted tapping the fund for 
international bailouts _ that Rubin has been extraordinarily cautious 
ever since. He committed $3 billion in a ``second line of defense'' 
in emergency aid programs for Indonesia and South Korea last year, 
but no money was ultimately dispersed to either country. U.S. officials 
said that South Korea did not need the extra help, and that the collapse 
of the Suharto government in Indonesia so changed the political scene 
there that it would be too risky to offer direct U.S. aid. In the 
bailout of Russia _ whose economy collapsed after President Boris 
Yeltsin abandoned an agreement to reform the economy and dismissed 
the leading reformers _ the United States offered no direct help. 
Those events set off a panicked exit by investors from all emerging 
markets, and greatly worsened Brazil's troubles. So far, Brazilian 
officials have successfully calmed the market by constantly talking 
about a forthcoming aid program from the IMF, convincing speculators 
that it would be dangerous to bet against the country. But at the 
same time, the Brazilian officials have maintained the pose that they 
do not really need the cash _ and are certainly in no hurry to get 
it. U.S. officials and top officials of the IMF are clearly nervous, 
worried that the longer the negotiations drag on, the greater will 
be the risk of Brazil being caught in another round of market turmoil. 
``The Brazilians want everyone to think that it's all under control,'' 
said an investment banker involved in the talks. ``But the fact is 
that there's still a real risk that sometime in the next 18 months 
the government is going to be forced to devalue'' its currency, which 
is pegged to the dollar, but adjusts about 7.5 percent a year in a 
carefully controlled fall. To prevent a sudden devaluation, the Brazilian 
government has had to raise interest rates to more than 50 percent, 
choking off credit for most companies. Meanwhile, the country is slipping 
into recession. The aid would buy time for the Brazilians, but it 
is contingent on Cardoso's success in persuading the legislature to 
end huge deficits, chiefly through unpopular cuts in social spending. 
The first deputy managing director for the International Monetary 
Fund, Stanley Fischer, spent Friday in Brazil to review the country's 
austerity plan, which is expected to be announced after Sunday's elections 
but before the international package, to avoid the appearance that 
the global lender is dictating conditions to Brazil. ``Brazil has 
to do a lot,'' Fischer said last week before leaving on his trip. 
``In return, I expect the international community will make a large 
contribution.''
