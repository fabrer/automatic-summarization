A South Korean lawmaker said Friday communist North Korea could be 
producing plutonium and could have more secret underground nuclear 
facilities than already feared. Without naming his source, Rep. Kim 
Deog-ryong of the Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee said he had 
``information'' that two underground facilities captured on U.S. spy 
satellite photos may be nuclear plants. He said in a Parliament session 
that one of them is believed to already be producing plutonium and 
the other would be able to produce enough for 10 nuclear bombs starting 
around 2004. If true, the assertion paints a worse picture of suspected 
North Korean nuclear activity than already made public. Kim said he 
asked the government's Unification Ministry about the issue earlier 
this week and was suspicious of its answer. ``It was not sufficient 
or sincere, so I came to suspect that the government is trying to 
hide the truth,'' Kim said in a seven-page press release. U.S. and 
South Korean officials said in August they had detected a huge underground 
construction site on a mountainside 40 kilometers (25 miles) northeast 
of Yongbyon, the country's main nuclear complex. The United States 
has said it suspects the construction is nuclear-related, though it 
has no evidence. North Korea has denied it. Kim, a lawmaker from the 
main opposition Grand National Party, said there may actually be two 
underground facilities not far from the Yongbyon complex. It was activity 
at Yongbyon that prompted the United States to negotiate a 1994 accord 
promising development of two light-water reactors and fuel-oil shipments 
if North Korea would halt nuclear weapons development. At the time, 
North Korea was believed to have made enough plutonium for one or 
two atomic bombs. The Yongbyon complex, which houses a 500-megawatt 
laboratory nuclear reactor, has been frozen under the 1994 accord. 
Kim said Friday that one new facility is already operating and the 
other is under construction and will be operational in four to six 
years. ``We estimate that the reactor will go on-line in 2002 or 2003, 
enabling the production of enough plutonium to build one nuclear weapon 
within six to 12 months,'' Kim said. ``North Korea would be able to 
make sufficient plutonium to make eight to 10 nuclear weapons every 
year after that.'' North Korea has said the underground construction 
is for civilian use and not nuclear-related. It has offered to open 
the facility to U.S. inspectors, but says Washington must pay compensation 
if the facility is been proven to be for civilian use.

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton won South Korea's 
support Saturday for confronting North Korea over a suspected nuclear 
site, and he warned the North's communist leaders not to squander 
a chance to achieve lasting peace on the peninsula. President Kim 
Dae-jung, appearing with Clinton at a news conference, pledged to 
``spare no effort in supporting the U.S. endeavor'' to resolve the 
nuclear question. He called for full access for U.S. inspectors at 
a North Korean underground facility and said the North must not develop 
missiles. On the first of two days in South Korea, Clinton also held 
a roundtable discussion with business leaders to hear their prescriptions 
for putting the nation's economy back on track. Economics and security 
are Clinton's twin themes on a five-day Asia trip that began in Japan. 
Clinton acknowledged that U.S. intelligence officials are not yet 
certain that the suspicious underground construction project in North 
Korea is nuclear related. But he said the North risks closing the 
door on cooperation if it refuses a U.S. inspection of the site. On

that U.S. intelligence officials are not yet certain that the underground 
construction project in North Korea is nuclear related. But he said 
the North risks closing the door on cooperation if it refuses a U.S. 
inspection of the site. ``It raises a strong suspicion,'' Clinton 
said at a joint news conference with Kim at the Blue House, the presidential 
mansion overlooking the capital. ``We need access to it.'' The foundation 
of U.S. efforts to ease North Korea's decades-long hostility toward 
the South is a 1994 ``agreed framework'' in which the North halted 
its nuclear weapons program in exchange for a Western commitment to 
build modern nuclear energy sources there. That deal would be shattered 
if the suspect site turned out to be a clandestine nuclear project. 
Kim, who has moved South Korea to a ``sunshine'' policy of engaging 
North Korea on cultural and economic fronts, was firm in saying his 
government supports Clinton on the nuclear issue. In meetings this 
week in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, U.S. officials were rebuffed 
in their request to see the suspicious site, which American intelligence 
officials fear could be a secret effort to revive the North's nuclear 
weapons program. ``We must require full access and ways to ascertain 
the nature and the purposes of the construction site,'' Kim said. 
``If it is, in fact, proven that it is nuclear related, we should 
demand immediate close down.'' He also said the North must limit its 
missile development, citing the ``great shock'' in Japan when the 
North Koreans test-fired a missile its way Aug. 31. U.S. spy satellite 
photos show thousands of workers digging a massive complex. U.S. special 
envoy Charles Kartman on Friday retracted an assessment he made Thursday 
that there was ``compelling evidence'' that North Korea is building 
an underground nuclear facility. In a statement distributed by the 
U.S. embassy here today, Kartman said instead, ``There is strong information 
that makes us suspicious, but we lack conclusive evidence that the 
intended purpose of the underground site is nuclear related and, if 
so, what type of nuclear facility it might be.'' Kim said his government 
would support U.S. efforts to resolve the nuclear question. The North 
Koreans have denied the underground construction site has any nuclear 
purpose, and have proposed a dlrs 300 million payment for allowing 
inspections. Clinton rejected the idea of compensation. Directing 
his remarks at North Korea, Clinton noted the significance of a new 
tourism deal that is bringing South Koreans to the North on cruise 
ships _ an arrangement touted by Kim as a sign the North may be opening 
up to its 1950s Korean War enemy. ``Nothing could ever be put into 
that hole in the ground, given our defense partnership here, that 
would give the North Koreans as much advantage, as much power, as 
much wealth, as much happiness, as more of those ships going up there 
full of people from here,'' Clinton said. In his meeting with Korean 
community and business leaders at Seoul's National Folklore Museum, 
Clinton praised South Korea's progress in recovering from its financial 
crisis. On a darker note, he mentioned recent tensions over Asian 
steel exports to the United States, which have skyrocketed this year 
at great cost to the domestic U.S. steelmakers. Japanese steel is 
the biggest problem, but South Korean steel exports also are on the 
rise. Clinton said the U.S. economy could tolerate increased imports 
_ if they are not concentrated in just a few industries, and if the 
result is that the Asian economies begin to recover. ``We have to 
be sensitive if the price of doing that is to basically erase'' an 
entire sector of the U.S. economy, Clinton said.

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton won South Korea's 
support Saturday for confronting North Korea over a suspected nuclear 
site, and he warned the North's communist leaders not to squander 
an historic chance to make a lasting peace on the peninsula. President

that his government would ``spare no effort in supporting the U.S.

for U.S. inspectors at a North Korean underground facility and said 
the North must constrain its development and exports of missiles. 
On the first of two days in South Korea, Clinton also held a roundtable 
discussion with business leaders to hear their prescriptions for putting 
the nation's economy back on track. Economics and security are Clinton's 
twin themes on a five-day Asia trip that began in Japan. Clinton acknowledged

the North halted its nuclear weapons program in exchange for a Western

would be shattered if the suspect site turned out to be a clandestine

peace talks that could produce a treaty to replace the shaky armistice 
that ended the Korean War in 1953. Kim, who has moved South Korea 
to a ``sunshine'' policy of engaging North Korea on cultural and economic 
fronts, firmly said his government supports Clinton on the nuclear 
issue. ``We must require full access and ways to ascertain the nature 
and the purposes of the construction site,'' Kim said. ``If it is,

tensions, ``North Korea is cautiously but noticeably taking measures 
to increase interaction and cooperation between the South and the 
North.'' And Clinton saluted Seoul's battle against Asia's economic 
woes. ``I believe Asia will emerge from this present crisis more prosperous, 
more stable, more democratic _ thanks in no small measure to Korea's 
example.'' After the state dinner, Clinton made a surprise late-night 
stop at a concert at the Sejong Culture Center where his younger brother, 
Roger, and his band were performing. The president listened to songs 
off stage before his brother introduced the president as ``a very 
special person.'' The audience of 2,000 people stood and applauded. 
In meetings this week in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, U.S. 
officials were rebuffed in their request to see the suspicious underground 
site, which American intelligence officials fear could be a secret 
effort to revive the North's nuclear weapons program. U.S. spy satellite

there was ``compelling evidence'' of an underground nuclear facility. 
But in a statement distributed by the U.S. Embassy here Saturday, 
Kartman backtracked, saying instead that the United States lacks ``conclusive 
evidence'' the site is a nuclear facility. ``There is strong information 
that makes us suspicious, but we lack conclusive evidence that the 
intended purpose of the underground site is nuclear related and, if 
so, what type of nuclear facility it might be,'' Kartman said, offering 
a ``clarification'' of his earlier remarks. Kim said his government 
would ``spare no effort in supporting the U.S. endeavor'' to resolve 
the nuclear question. The North Koreans have denied the underground 
construction site has any nuclear purpose, and it has demanded a dlrs 
300 million payment for proving that. In remarks in Tokyo on Friday, 
Clinton rejected the idea of compensation. Directing his remarks at 
North Korea, Clinton noted the significance of a new tourism deal 
that is bringing South Koreans to the North on cruise ships _ an arrangement 
touted by Kim as a sign the North may be opening up to its 1950s Korean 
War enemy. To risk that kind of cooperation _ and progress with America 
on other issues _ by stonewalling on the suspected nuclear site is 
contrary to the North's long-term interests, he said. ``Nothing could 
ever be put into that hole in the ground, given our defense partnership 
here, nothing could ever be put in that hole in the ground that would 
give the North Koreans as much advantage, as much power, as much wealth, 
as much happiness, as more of those ships going up there full of people 
from here,'' Clinton said. To underscore the U.S. military commitment 
to South Korea, Clinton was scheduled to venture out of the capital 
on Sunday to visit U.S. Army troops at a training range north of Seoul. 
He also planned to address American troops at Osan Air Base from a 
U-2 spy plane hangar.

North Korean news media on Thursday said the communist nation's military 
is on full alert for war with the United States if a dispute over 
nuclear inspections comes to blows. The North's official Korean Central 
News Agency reported that North Korean soldiers and people of all 
walks of life were ``on full alert for war.'' North Korea typically 
sends out belligerent rhetoric, especially when it enters high-stake 
talks with Washington. The United States and North Korea are set to 
resume talks Friday about inspections of an underground North Korean 
site suspected of being used to produce nuclear weapons. KCNA broadcasts 
brimmed with anti-American saber-rattling. ``Our People's Army will 
blow up the U.S. territory as a whole'' if the United States starts 
a war on the divided Korean Peninsula, Vice Defense Minister Jong 
Chang Ryol was quoted as saying Thursday. The general staff of the 
North Korean military accused Washington on Wednesday of pushing the 
situation in Korea to the ``brink of war'' by demanding inspections 
and talks aimed at preventing Pyongyang from developing nuclear weapons 
and long-range missiles. ``Under the prevailing touch-and-go situation, 
the Korean People's Army is now bracing itself for a fight against 
the U.S. imperialist aggressors,'' KCNA quoted Jong as saying. The 
agency also quoted various party officials, plant managers, even museum 
curators as pledging a ``thousandfold revenge'' or vowing to arm themselves 
with the ``spirit of human bombs and of suicidal attack.'' Washington 
demands unconditional inspections of the North's underground project. 
But North Korea asked Washington to pay dlrs 300 million for the right 
to inspect the site. Concerns that North Korea was developing long-range 
missiles capable of striking all of Japan and parts of the United 
States escalated when North Korea fired a rocket on Aug. 31. Believed 
to be a test of its Taepo Dong missile, the rocket flew over Japan 
and landed in the Pacific Ocean. The North's 1.1 million-strong military 
is the world's fifth largest. It forms the backbone of the North Korean 
government, with leader Kim Jong Il ruling the country as the head 
of the military.

North Korea has agreed to receive a U.S. delegation next month to 
discuss American concerns about the construction of a vast underground 
complex that is widely feared to house a nuclear weapons program, 
the State Department said on Wednesday. The delegation, led by Charles 
Kartman, will press for access to the site, which American intelligence 
agencies believe could be the centerpiece of an effort to revive a 
frozen nuclear arms program. ``We've made clear to the North Koreans 
that any attempt by North Korea to pursue a nuclear weapons development 
program would be unacceptable,'' the State Department spokesman, James 
Rubin, said. The talks in Pyongyang, the capital, he added, ``are 
aimed at completely satisfying U.S. concerns about the suspect construction.'' 
American intelligence agencies fear that building the complex could 
be an effort to break out of a four-year-old pact in which North Korea 
pledged to give up its nuclear-weapons program in exchange for billions 
of dollars in aid from the United States, South Korea and Japan. American 
officials have said spy satellites have recently photographed thousands 
of North Koreans around the huge site 25 miles northeast of Yongbyon, 
the nuclear center where North Korea was believed to have stockpiled 
enough plutonium before the 1994 accords to build six or more bombs. 
Although they have not explained exactly why the government is building 
the complex, North Korean officials have denied that it would be used 
to develop nuclear weapons. The official North Korean press agency 
said last week that the government was building ``civilian underground 
structures on which any `doubt' cannot be cast'' and suggested that 
American officials would be allowed to inspect the complex if they 
pressed for access. ``If the U.S. side persists in inspecting our 
underground structures,'' the press agency said, ``we can show it 
to them.'' Rubin said the United States had received no formal assurances 
that Kartman, the American special envoy for Korean nuclear issues, 
and his delegation would be allowed to inspect the site on the trip, 
which is to begin on Nov. 16. ``We are beginning a discussion with 
them in which we will demand access,'' Rubin said. ``The history of 
the U.S.-North Korea discussions involves usually a lengthy discussion 
process before there is agreement to our requirements. So we are not 
expecting to walk in one day and be able to have access the next.'' 
The trip was announced as signs grow about a relative warming of relations 
between the United States and North Korea. Representatives of the 
United States, China and the two Koreas met recently in Geneva and 
agreed to steps to reduce tension on the Korean Peninsula. In September 
the United States pledged to provide an additional 300,000 tons of 
grain to North Korea, which has for years been crippled by severe 
food shortages. In addition the White House disclosed that the United 
States would provide more heavy fuel oil promised to North Korea under 
the 1994 agreement, despite concerns that North Korea may intend to 
revive its nuclear program. American officials have said the activity 
near Yongbyon may not yet have technically violated the accord, because 
there is no evidence that North Korea has begun pouring cement for 
a new reactor or a reprocessing plant to convert nuclear waste to 
bomb-grade plutonium. 
 NYT19981114.0099 
A congressman who visited remote parts of North Korea last week said 
Saturday that the food and health situation there was desperate and 
deteriorating, and that millions of North Koreans might have starved 
to death in the last few years. The congressman, Tony Hall, D-Ohio, 
who has had a longtime interest in world hunger, passed through Tokyo 
on his return to the United States and showed photographs he had taken 
of North Korean children with patchy hair, protruding bones, open 
sores and other signs of severe malnutrition. Hall also brought back 
a bag of what officials called ``substitute food'' being distributed 
by a government food station: dried leaves and straw, so coarse that 
even cattle would normally turn away. ``They grind it into powder 
and make it into noodles,'' Hall said. The noodles have no nutrition 
and are indigestible, leaving people holding their aching stomachs, 
he said. North Korea has admitted that it is facing serious economic 
difficulties, but there have been sharply diverging assessments of 
how serious these are. Some visitors with the United Nations and other 
organizations have said that the food situation seems to be a bit 
better now than a year or two ago. Hall said that the divergence might 
have arisen because in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, life did 
seem to be slightly better than during his three previous trips to 
North Korea. But in rural areas where foreigners are not often allowed 
to visit, he added, the overall situation is worse than ever. Based 
on visits to four hospitals, Hall also emphasized that public health 
care had declined sharply. In one hospital, assistants were holding 
down a patient while surgeons conducted a stomach operation without 
electric lights or anesthesia. Ordinary North Koreans are suffering, 
in part, because their government's hard-line policies have alienated 
would-be donors and aid agencies. The United Nations has repeatedly 
appealed for relief aid for North Korea, but the latest appeal has 
raised less than one-third of the target. In September, Doctors Without 
Borders announced that it was pulling its staff of 13 from North Korea 
because it feared that its aid was going to the politically connected 
rather than to the most needy. North Korea does not release mortality 
figures or health statistics, but Hall said that the United Nations 
had gathered and would soon release data indicating that 30 percent 
of North Korean children under age 2 are acutely malnourished and 
that 67 percent of all children are physically stunted. Hall said 
he thought that overall at least 1 million people had died and that 
the total was probably closer to 3 million. In an indication of the 
seriousness with which professional demographers view the situation, 
the U.S. Bureau of the Census recently published estimates suggesting 
that North Korea's population peaked in 1995 at 21.55 million and 
has since fallen to 21.23 million this year. That would be a decline 
of 320,000 over three years, a period when North Korea's population 
would have been expected to grow by about 925,000 people, based on 
the population growth rate of the early 1990s. Nicholas Eberstadt, 
an American specialist on North Korean population figures, says that 
there simply is not enough hard information for him to estimate the 
death toll from the famine. But he notes one political tidbit: North 
Korea's constitution stipulates that there should be one delegate 
to the country's ``people's assembly'' for every 30,000 citizens. 
This year's assembly did not expand as previous ones did, but rather 
had just 687 delegates, the same as the previous assembly held in 
1990. While Eberstadt counsels caution, that could mean that North 
Korea's population, after eight years in which it had been expected 
to add several million people, is now back to 20.6 million people 
or fewer. The United States has been supplying grain to North Korea, 
but strains are growing over a secret underground complex in the North 
that some experts worry may be the heart of a new nuclear weapons 
program. The United States warned last week that the ``agreed framework'' 
that is the basis for its relations with North Korea will be in jeopardy 
unless the North lets American experts visit the underground complex 
and resolve their doubts. North Korea has said that it will show off 
the complex only if Washington promises that if the complex is not 
a nuclear one, it will pay for ``vilifying us and impairing our prestige.'' 
Washington refuses to pay, and North Korea is warning that the standoff 
could lead the agreement to fall apart. ``Their shameless and wicked 
demand is an open infringement upon our sovereignty and wanton interference 
in our internal affairs,'' declared North Korea's leading newspaper, 
Rodong Sinmun. 
 NYT19981118.0464 
North Korea has demanded that the United States pay hundreds of millions 
of dollars for the right to inspect a huge underground center that 
U.S. intelligence analysts fear houses a nuclear-weapons program, 
Clinton administration officials said Wednesday. The United States 
rejected the request during meetings this week in Pyongyang, the North 
Korean capital, between North Korean officials and a U.S. government 
delegation. ``As we expected, the North Koreans brought up the issue 
of compensation, and we flatly rejected it,'' said State Department 
Spokesman James Rubin. Asked how much money the North Koreans had 
demanded, Rubin said payment of the fee was ``so not on as a possibility 
that I don't care to get into the figures.'' Other administration 
officials said the fee would have been hundreds of millions of dollars; 
one put it at $300 million. The North Koreans have denied that the 
complex, which is being built on a mountainside about 25 miles northeast 
of Yongbyon, the former North Korean nuclear research center, is intended 
to be used for a nuclear weapons program. They have repeatedly said 
U.S. inspectors could visit the site as long as Washington agreed 
to pay a large fee in compensation for what the North Koreans describe 
as the administration's slander. The North Korean representative at 
the United Nations, Kim Chang Guk, said last week that the United 
States could inspect the site ``on condition that when it is confirmed 
not to be a nuclear facility, the United States should pay compensation 
for slandering and defaming my country.'' U.S. intelligence agencies 
fear that by building the complex, North Korea may have decided to 
abandon a four-year-old agreement with the United States in which 
North Korea pledged to give up its nuclear weapons program in exchange 
for billions of dollars in aid. The U.S. delegation, led by Charles 
Kartman, President Clinton's special envoy on North Korean issues, 
left Pyongyang on Wednesday after 12 hours of negotiations over three 
days with a team from the North Korean Foreign Ministry. The talks 
ended as Clinton began a trip to Asia that will include a visit to 
South Korea, where the issue of the North Korean construction site 
is expected to be among the major topics discussed with President 
Kim Dae-jung. Rubin said the U.S. delegation to North Korea had pressed 
for access to the site. ``We told them that access to the site is 
essential,'' he said. ``We've expected that this would be difficult, 
and we told the North Koreans, as we've said before, that verbal assurances, 
as they are wont to give, are simply unacceptable.'' U.S. officials 
have said the construction of the underground site may not yet have 
technically violated the accord, because there is no evidence that 
North Korea has begun pouring cement for a new reactor or a reprocessing 
plant to convert nuclear waste to bomb-grade plutonium. But if the 
United States determines that North Korea has revived its nuclear 
program, Rubin said, ``it would go against the entire letter and spirit 
of the objectives of the agreement, and it would affect the viability 
of the agreement.'' The administration has expressed growing concern 
over North Korea's intentions after several provocative acts, including 
the underground construction near Yongbyon and the test firing last 
August of a missile over Japan. Last week Clinton named former Defense 
Secretary William Perry to review U.S. policy toward North Korea. 
Administration officials say Perry is being asked to study ways to 
salvage the 1994 nuclear agreement with North Korea, which had been 
among the administration's proudest achievements in foreign policy.

This city has always kept an unwritten list of foreign leaders _ dictators, 
unfriendly authoritarians and consistently annoying allies _ who it 
thinks can make an enormous contribution to peace, security or America's 
agenda by taking early retirement, at a minimum. In the 1950s, the 
leftist leaders of Iran and Guatamala made the Top 10, in the '60s 
it was populated by Diem and Sukarno and other Southeast Asians. President 
Richard M. Nixon and his advisers infamously agreed at a secret meeting 
in the '70s that the best way to deal with the government of Salvador 
Allende Gossens in Chile was to ``make the economy scream.'' Diplomatic 
etiquette, though, has usually discouraged shouting America's enemies 
list from the White House rooftop. After all, foreign policy isn't 
about personalities, right? But last week, driven by frustration, 
or anxiety, or perhaps the lure of sounding tough for cameras, the 
Clinton administration piped up, twice. In very different situations, 
in opposite corners of the world, the United States spoke loudly because 
it can't find a stick. Sunday, hours after he called off an attack 
on Iraq, Clinton finally volunteered the obvious, that the focus of 
U.S. policy toward Iraq is the removal of President Saddam Hussein 
_ what Clinton called supporting the ``forces of change in Iraq.'' 
No matter that covert efforts to do just that have failed miserably. 
The bigger surprise came Monday, when polite-to-a-fault Al Gore used 
his visit to Malaysia for an Asian economic summit meeting to throw 
U.S. support behind protesters calling for ``reformasi,'' the code 
word on the streets of Kuala Lumpur for dumping Prime Minister Mahathir 
Mohamed. He has long been a burr in Washington's side, denouncing 
America, its currency traders and its Jews. He recently imprisoned 
his Western-thinking finance minister, Anwar Ibrahim, who has suddenly 
become Asia's most visible jailed dissident. But Mahathir is no Saddam, 
not by a long shot. Gore's aides insist that his speech was a call 
for reform, not a demand that Mahathir step down. But it wasn't interpreted 
that way. The New Zealanders called it ``megaphone diplomacy.'' The 
Malaysian government called it ``disgusting'' and an ``interference 
in internal affairs.'' Predictably, executives of several U.S. companies 
that have flocked to Kuala Lumpur told the Malaysians that Gore was 
rude, while assuring Washington that he had uttered words that needed 
to be said. Whatever the wisdom of the Gore's words, they raised the 
question of what it takes these days for the world's most powerful 
nation to begin publicly suggesting that it's time for a nettlesome 
leader to go. Because there is no official list, there are no real 
criteria for getting on it. Some leaders mysteriously escape mention, 
like Kim Jong Il of North Korea. President Clinton is spending the 
weekend on the Korean Peninsula, staring across the demilitarized 
zone at a dangerous state that everyone suspects is attempting to 
break out of its 1994 agreement to freeze its nuclear weapons projects, 
in return for billions in Western energy aid. Yet Washington has never 
called on the starving North Koreans to revolt against Kim's repressive 
regime. His government, taking a page out of the Saddam playbook, 
suggested last week that if the United States really wants to look 
at a mountain tunnel that the Pentagon believes is a nuclear installation 
in the making, it should write a check for another $300 million. No 
one even called for Kim's removal when, a few months ago, he lobbed 
a three-stage missile over Japan just to show he knew how. ``The rules 
for calling for the end of a regime are pretty murky,'' said Richard 
Feinberg, a professor at the University of California at San Diego 
who served in the Clinton administration's first term. ``When they 
really want to push someone out, it is because that country is part 
of a larger strategic concern at the time. But the country itself 
usually doesn't have great strategic weight'' _ it's another matter 
to call for a change of leadership in Beijing or Moscow _ ``and it 
helps if there is some kind of domestic opposition that we can point 
to.'' Clinton's call for Saddam's ouster last weekend created barely 
a ripple because, after all, he is a proven murderer and an avid stockpiler 
of anthrax and plutonium (even if Brent Scowcroft, who was President 
George Bush's national security adviser, insisted last week that Saddam 
nowadays is simply ``an irritant, an annoyance, a pest and a problem, 
but not a threat to the region at the moment''). Mahathir, however, 
is far more complex case. He's a prime example of how opposing Washington's 
political and economic agenda for an interconnected world can move 
a leader from the list of authoritarians whom Washington tolerates 
to the list of authoritarians who have outlived their usefulness. 
Like other Asian strongmen _ Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines and 
Suharto of Indonesia come to mind _ he was useful when the fear was 
that Malaysia would become a communist domino. But he also seemed 
eminently tolerable long after the Cold War was over. He has never 
been accused of enormous corruption. He turned his country into a 
model of competitiveness, and Malaysia became the exemplar of the 
``big emerging markets'' that Clinton's Commerce Department touted 
until things went sour last year. Sure, he was always prickly. But 
he is no terrorist or killer _ U.S. companies have flocked to his 
country, and say they want to stay _ and his iron control over political 
discourse is no stronger than in neighboring Singapore. Just this 
summer, U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin paid him an ostensibly 
friendly, if strained, visit and made no reference to human rights. 
That all changed when Ibrahim was arrested and beaten in jail. He 
has long been an advocate of the Western-style solutions to economic 
turmoil _ more openness, more freedom _ and the protest movement against 
Mahathir only surfaced once he was in jail. Gore leapt on that opportunity 
_ particularly striking because, in the case of Indonesia earlier 
this year, it took the administration months to come to the conclusion 
that President Suharto had to go. He went.

President Clinton made an unusual, direct appeal to North Korea on 
Saturday to set aside any nuclear ambitions in favor of strengthening 
ties to South Korea and the United States. The appeal came during 
a meeting with reporters at which he also counseled patience over 
Iraq's refusal to comply with a request from weapons inspectors. ``I 
think it's important that we not overreact here on the first day,'' 
Clinton said in response to reports that Iraq had balked at a request 
by U.N. inspectors for documents on its weapons program. But, speaking 
at a joint appearance with South Korean President Kim Dae Jung, Clinton 
called the requested documents ``quite important'' and said Iraq had 
``some affirmative obligations'' to help weapons inspectors. Aides 
to Clinton denied that his comments represented any softening toward 
Iraq. They said that because the situation was still developing and 
the president was preparing for meetings with Kim he had not been 
briefed in detail on Iraq's resistance when he appeared before reporters 
Saturday. National Security Adviser Sandy Berger said the administration 
was consulting with other members of the U.N. Security Council about 
the matter. If Iraq fails to meet its obligations under U.N. resolutions, 
he said, ``We obviously are prepared to act.'' Last weekend, Clinton 
called off a strike against Iraq minutes before it was to begin, delayed 
his departure for Asia to monitor the crisis and said that U.S. forces 
remained poised to strike if Iraq reneged on its agreement to let 
U.N. weapons inspectors do their work. In his appearance with Kim, 
the president addressed a handful of questions that ranged from North 
Korea to Indonesia to whether the Congress should punish him over 
the Lewinsky scandal. Before leaving Washington for this five-day 
trip to Japan, Korea and Guam, he drew a parallel between the governments 
of Iraq and North Korea, saying, ``We must be no less concerned by 
North Korea's weapons activities.'' The Clinton administration is 
urgently seeking to inspect a vast construction site in North Korea 
that it believes may be the beginnings of a nuclear weapons plant. 
Saturday, Clinton called that site, together with North Korea's test 
firing in August of a missile over Japan, ``cause for deep concern.'' 
But the Clinton administration is trying a very different approach 
toward North Korea than toward Iraq, partly at the urging of Kim, 
who is pursuing a ``sunshine policy'' of engagement with the North. 
As Clinton and Kim delivered prepared statements and answered questions 
Saturday, Clinton became most animated in describing what he called 
``a very beautiful picture'' that he happened to spot after turning 
on his hotel television on arriving in Seoul on Friday night: film 
of a cruise ship recently permitted to carry South Koreans on a tour 
into the North. ``I ask the North Koreans to think about this,'' he 
said, arguing that Kim's policy of engagement with the North presented 
them with a great opportunity. ``Nothing could ever be put in that 
hole in the ground that would give the North Koreans as much advantage, 
as much power, as much wealth, as much happiness as more of those 
ships going up there full of people from here.'' The Clinton administration 
fears that the construction site may be evidence that North Korea 
has abandoned a 1994 pledge to the United States to give up its nuclear 
weapons program in exchange for billions of dollars in aid. The North 
Koreans have denied that the complex is intended to help build nuclear 
weapons. But they have demanded that the United States pay $300 million 
to inspect it, a request rejected this week by a U.S. delegation to 
Pyongyang, the North Korean capital. The new complex is being built 
on a mountainside about 25 miles northeast of Yongbyon, the former 
North Korean nuclear research center. Kim continued Saturday to emphasize 
his hopes for a new opening toward North Korea. But he said, ``We 
will not tolerate any possible attempt of North Korea to proliferate 
nuclear weapons, missiles and other weapons of mass destruction.'' 
The Clinton administration plans to resume negotiating with North 
Korea over inspecting the site in December. In addition to strategies 
for easing the Asian financial crisis, Clinton discussed North Korea 
during a visit to Tokyo on Thursday and Friday. The subject of North 
Korea consumed most of his two hours of meetings with Kim here Saturday 
at the Blue House, which contains the Korean president's office and 
home. The administration has been criticized in Congress and in this 
region for letting its policy on North Korea drift, but Clinton called 
that policy a ``clear-eyed mix'' of diplomacy and deterrence. He said 
that so far the 1994 agreement had worked, because without it ``North 
Korea already would have produced a sizable amount of weapons-grade 
plutonium.'' Under pressure from congressional critics, Clinton last 
week appointed William Perry, his former defense secretary, to review 
his policy on North Korea. On other matters, Clinton declined to criticize 
the government of Indonesia for using force to crack down on protesters 
there, saying that he did not ``have enough facts at this moment to 
give you the right answer.'' But he said he hoped there would be ``no 
backsliding'' in Indonesia. Clinton followed his appearance with Kim 
with a visit to the National Folk Museum here, where he conducted 
an hourlong conversation with six Korean academics, businessmen and 
union leaders about the troubled state of Korea's economy and its 
impact on the society. He attended a state dinner Saturday night, 
before stopping by a concert where his brother, Roger, a musician, 
happened to be performing. Clinton repeatedly congratulated Kim for 
his efforts at economic reform, noting that interest rates had fallen 
here and the currency had stabilized. But he also pressed Kim during 
their private meetings to restructure the five huge conglomerates, 
or chaebols, that account for some 40 percent of the Korean economy. 
In describing the leaders' conversation, Berger called restructuring 
the chaebols ``perhaps the most serious remaining problem in the South 
Korean economy.'' Clinton said during the economic forum Saturday 
afternoon that he felt impatient about South Korea's failure to act 
on the chaebols. It may be necessary to proceed slowly with the restructuring, 
he said, ``but they should begin.'' On Sunday, Clinton plans to visit 
some of the 37,000 American troops stationed here.

In a green aviator jacket and black cap, President Clinton spent Sunday 
visiting American troops stationed in South Korea. He promoted a private, 
sang birthday greetings to a sergeant major and described the threats 
to his hopes for peaceful engagement with North Korea. ``Lately, signs 
of danger have intensified,'' Clinton said in an address to airmen 
here, standing before a gunmetal gray F-16 and A-10 parked nose-to-nose. 
``So we must remain vigilant. And thanks to you, we are.'' For all 
his eagerness to talk about information-age economic dangers like 
quicksilver currency flows, Clinton has returned again and again during 
his five-day trip to Japan and South Korea to the old-style regional 
military threat posed by North Korea. The subject consumed most of 
his meetings with President Kim Dae-jung of South Korea on Saturday 
and formed the backdrop for his visits with the troops Sunday. ``It's 
kind of tense around here,'' said John Kelley, a 26-year-old airman 
from Wisconsin, describing life on this base. ``You know you're only 
four minutes away from a missile.'' In his speech, Clinton pointed 
to recent North Korean missile tests, incursions into the south and 
a mysterious underground site that may be a nuclear weapons installation 
as signs of the potential threat. And he compared North Korea to Iraq, 
saying that North Korea was ``also a major concern'' because of its 
chemical and biological weapons. Until North Korea ``fully commits 
itself to a constructive role on this peninsula,'' he said, ``we must 
remain ready.'' Clinton restated his support for Kim's policy of engagement 
with North Korea, though, saying that there were ``some hopeful signs'' 
to justify it. He pointed to talks that began over the summer between 
the American military command in Korea and the North Korean military 
to prevent problems along the demilitarized zone between the south 
and north. Clinton planned to leave South Korea early Monday and return 
to Washington Monday night, after paying a visit to Guam. On a bright 
but icy afternoon, Clinton was warmly received here by soldiers in 
camouflage and black boots, some of whom waited almost three hours, 
shifting from foot to foot and rubbing their hands. The official crowd 
estimate was only 3,500, but the turnout seemed even smaller. The 
base, about 30 miles south of Seoul, is one of two major American 
airfields in Korea, housing 7,500 airmen. Others who wanted to see 
the president were bused in from sites that are hours away. Before 
flying here by helicopter, Clinton attended church on an Army base 
in Seoul, then visited a firing range just 12 miles from the demilitarized 
zone. In a brief ceremony there, he promoted Matt Prickett of West 
Liberty, Ohio, from private first class to specialist. And he led 
the troops in a round of ``Happy Birthday'' for Sgt. Maj. Charles 
Thomas of Wilson, N.C., who turned 45 on Sunday. ``It definitely caught 
me off guard,'' Thomas said.
