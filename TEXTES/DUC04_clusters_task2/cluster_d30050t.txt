In a cocoon of loyal and wealthy supporters, President Clinton said 
Friday that he must ``live with the consequences'' of his mistakes, 
although he contended that Democrats should take pride in the achievements 
of his presidency and take heart from its possibilities. Clinton has 
stopped apologizing for his conduct with Monica Lewinsky, but he has 
taken to making glancing, at times humble, references to it, before 
moving on to attack the Republican Congress as indifferent to Americans' 
needs. He did so Friday at a series of fund-raisers. In one deft sentence, 
he acknowledged his personal pain while claiming credit for the country's 
economic strength, making a compact appeal for both sympathy and support 
in an appearance earlier in the day in Cleveland. After thanking the 
gathered donors for the ``very kind personal things'' they had said 
to him, the president declared, ``If I had to do it all over again, 
every day, I would do it in a heartbeat, to see America where it is 
today as compared to six years ago.'' As the applause died away, Clinton 
continued, ``I want you to understand, too, that we all have to live 
with the consequences of our mistakes in life.'' He added with a chuckle: 
``Most of us don't have to live with it in quite such a public way. 
But nobody gets out of life for free.'' To the music of a saxophone 
and a hammered dulcimer, Clinton raised about $200,000 over lunch 
in a private home in Cleveland for the Democratic Senate candidate 
in Ohio, Mary Boyle. Then he flew to Philadelphia to raise half a 
million dollars for the Democratic Party. By midsummer, the president's 
aides were delighted to have persuaded him to condense his fund-raising 
remarks to just 10 minutes of policy points and partisan jabbing. 
But as his troubles have grown and the mid-term elections have approached, 
his free-form remarks have become longer. In Cleveland on Friday, 
he spoke for 26 minutes and here on Friday evening he spoke for almost 
20 minutes. These fund-raising visits have fallen into a pattern since 
Clinton's videotaped grand jury testimony on Aug. 17. He is lauded, 
applauded and embraced by his hosts and the donors. ``Mr. President, 
these are your friends here today,'' said Tony George, the host of 
the Cleveland event, offering the refrain of those who have played 
a similar role. But in Cleveland as elsewhere, protesters who were 
scattered along the president's motorcade route were reminders of 
calls for his resignation and impeachment, and of the mockery some 
are heaping upon his presidency. At a rally for the president outside 
city hall here Friday night a group of Teamsters chanted, ``two more 
years.'' Clinton's motorcade route was lined downtown with hundreds 
of people, some of them carrying supportive or condemnatory signs. 
After an impromptu shopping trip, during which he was greeted with 
shouts of ``We love you,'' Clinton told some donors at the beginning 
of an impassioned reprise of his Cleveland speech: ``I didn't even 
mind the protesters, that's the American way.'' But, he added, he 
preferred it when they were in the minority, ``and that seemed to 
be the case.'' As he rode into Cleveland, Clinton passed a billboard 
for a local radio station, WNCX. ``Lovin', touchin', squeezin','' 
it read, the words superimposed on a cartoon of the president with 
his arm over Ms. Lewinsky's shoulders, the Washington Monument beside 
them. The president left it to his aides on Friday to respond directly 
to the latest gusher of grand jury disclosures in Washington. Instead, 
in his remarks, Clinton spoke with pride of his record and with urgency 
about addressing the international economic crisis and the needs of 
struggling farmers and schoolchildren. As he typically does now before 
such partisan audiences, he also walked through his political calculation 
for the mid-term elections. Clinton said in Cleveland that Republicans 
had bragged privately to him about their prospects. ``They tell me, 
`Oh, we're going to do very well, Mr. President, in these mid-terms 
because we have so much more money than you do,''' and because Democrats 
who turned out to re-elect Clinton would not return to the polls in 
an off-year. That argument, of course, would also insulate Clinton 
from any blame for depressing the Democratic vote. But he often goes 
further than that, saying that his predicament could actually help 
the Democrats. Lower-income Democratic voters, he said, might not 
bother to vote in a typical election. ``The people that were good 
enough to serve you here at this event today, they've got a lot of 
hassles in their life,'' he said. But, he said, ``adversity is our 
friend,'' because it can overcome apathy and ``focus us on what is 
at issue here.'' What should be at issue, Clinton said, are his achievements 
and agenda and the Republicans' record, which he described harshly. 
``What have they done?'' he asked in Cleveland. ``They killed the 
minimum wage increase for 12 million Americans. They killed campaign 
finance reform. They killed the tobacco reform legislation.''

In other election years, Reps. David Price and Julia Carson would 
have had little in common other than that they were Democrats with 
relatively safe seats. Price is a centrist who has represented this 
high-tech district in North Carolina for all but 2 of the last 12 
years, a political scientist who has taught at Duke and Yale. Mrs. 
Carson, fairly liberal, is a House freshman who worked her way up 
in politics from the grass roots, having been reared in poverty. But 
party officials who opened this election year with high hopes of recapturing 
the House are beginning to worry that Democratic incumbents like Price 
and Mrs. Carson share something else: greater-than-expected peril 
on Election Day. As in many congressional races, the biggest variable 
is the White House scandal, which has injected fear and uncertainty 
into campaigns around the country. Other Democratic incumbents who 
Republican officials cite as locked in contests that are more competitive 
than expected include Reps. Corrine Brown of Florida, Vic Snyder of 
Arkansas, Lois Capps and Ellen Tauscher of California, Martin Frost 
of Texas, Melvin Watt of North Carolina, John LaFalce of New York 
and Sander Levin of Michigan. Here in North Carolina's 4th Congressional 
District, Price, acknowledging that his own polls showed him in a 
tight race, said: ``This is a swing district that is sensitive to 
any tide or trend. It's something you think about a lot in connection 
with the president's troubles.'' The efforts of Price and Mrs. Carson 
to contain the Lewinsky debacle _ and their opponents' attempts to 
capitalize on it _ offer important clues suggesting how Clinton's 
problems are influencing the conduct of races around the country. 
Many Democrats are straddling a line that seems to shift a bit with 
every new scandal-related disclosure: they do not want to appear close 
to a president whose conduct embarrasses them, and yet, sensing the 
possibility of a public backlash against Republicans, they are weighing 
their words carefully and are wary of hopping on any impeachment bandwagon. 
And while publicly these Democrats express confidence that the scandal 
will have little impact on them, their campaigns are preparing for 
the worst by placing greater emphasis than ever on behind-the-efforts 
to prod their core constituencies to vote. In a reflection of the 
uncertainty that the Clinton scandal has cast even among Republicans, 
the challengers in the Price and Carson districts _ both are political 
novices seeking office for the first time _ have differing strategies: 
Tom Roberg, a computer executive in Raleigh who is taking on Price, 
has broadcast a television commercial exploiting the scandal. ``Tom 
Roberg has called for Bill Clinton's resignation,'' the narrator says. 
``This is not the time to be silent, Price. Where do you stand?'' 
But in Indianapolis, Gary Hofmeister, a conservative jeweler challenging 
Mrs. Carson in Indiana's 10th Congressional District, is taking a 
more subtle approach: rather than mention the scandal directly, he 
notes as often as he can that ``Julia votes with Clinton almost 100 
percent of the time.'' Asked why he was not much raising the scandal 
directly, Hofmeister said: ``Don't murder somebody when they're in 
the process of committing suicide. There would be a danger if we went 
overboard.'' The best evidence of the discomfort of both Price and 
Mrs. Carson is that when asked in separate interviews whether they 
would want Clinton to campaign in their districts, both said it would 
be impossible at this late date for the White House to schedule a 
visit. What if there was a sudden schedule change? Both paused, squirmed 
a bit and mustered answers that were hardly affirmative. ``Given the 
president's popularity, I doubt it will hurt me,'' Mrs. Carson said. 
And Price? ``I don't think that would be such a good idea,'' he said. 
``I've never had a president campaign here, and I wouldn't want to 
start this time'' although he is eagerly welcoming Erskine Bowles, 
the president's chief of staff and a popular native son in North Carolina, 
to stump with him here this Sunday.) Making strategy for the stump 
is further complicated by anecdotal evidence that runs counter to 
Democratic fears and Republican hopes. In three days of campaign stops 
here in North Carolina and in Indianapolis, the scandal was rarely 
raised by any voter being courted by the candidates of either party. 
When a reporter asked about it, many voters said that as appalled 
as they were at Clinton's behavior, they had a hard time relating 
it to their decision on which way to vote in the congressional elections 
in five weeks. As Hofmeister walked through the parking lot outside 
a gun and knife show at the Indiana National Guard Armory in Indianapolis 
last Sunday, Billy Derringer, a 57-year-old machinist who is retired 
on disability, called him over to express outrage about the millions 
of dollars that had been spent to investigate Clinton. ``It's pathetic 
to spend all of our money,'' said Derringer, who identified himself 
as an independent. ``It shouldn't have gotten this far.'' Hofmeister 
tried his best to make the Republicans' case. ``There has to be rule 
of law,'' he said. Mrs. Carson said she hoped that Democrats and swing 
voters alike would become so fed up with the Lewinsky inquiry that 
the issue might even help her. To that end, she proudly informs audiences 
that she voted against making public the report delivered to the House 
by Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel. ``I was one 
of 63 members of Congress who voted against putting all that filth 
on the Internet,'' she said, adding that Starr's inquiry had been 
``a cruel hoax in terms of fiscal responsibility and accountability.'' 
The Carson campaign is counting on voters like Timothy Daly, a 38-year-old 
real estate executive who voted for a Republican two years ago but 
now favors Mrs. Carson. ``I'm pulling the Democratic ticket because 
I'm tired of it: the right side of the Republican Party is playing 
politics,'' Daly said. ``We'd like to see them go on with the people's 
business.'' Back here in the 4th District, Price has some reasons 
to be worried. He was first elected to the House in 1986 but, as a 
four-term incumbent, was ousted in the Republican sweep of 1994 (only 
to win his seat back two years later). In addition, the district was 
redrawn last year to include a large Durham section where voters do 
not know him well. Determined not to be a midterm casualty of Clinton 
once again, Price says he is waging the most vigorous get-out-the-vote 
ground campaign of his career. Rather than engage Roberg over the 
Clinton scandal, Price has begun broadcasting a television commercial 
that emphasizes his central issue: education. The congressman's advisers 
say they intentionally produced an advertisement that appears decidedly 
nonpolitical _ it features school children in a play _ in an effort 
to break through the television clutter about the scandal. But the 
Price campaign also has a weapon it is holding in reserve, in the 
event Roberg appears to be riding the Clinton scandal to advantage: 
the incumbent's advisers say they would not be timid about running 
commercials underscoring that he earned a divinity degree before getting 
his doctorate in political science. At a coffee with voters in a wealthy 
enclave of Raleigh the other night, Roberg opened his remarks by asserting 
that Clinton had ``lost the moral authority to lead.'' Yet none of 
those assembled asked him about the scandal; they were more concerned 
about the state's plans to build a highway near their neighborhood.

It was a surprising scene three months ago when Dennis Rivera, one 
of New York City's most left-leaning labor leaders, was singing the 
praises of Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato. Rivera, president of the largest 
union in New York City, praised D'Amato for persuading Trent Lott, 
the Senate majority leader, to support legislation that financed health 
coverage for hundreds of thousands of uninsured children. It looked 
as if Rivera's politically potent union might endorse D'Amato _ or 
at the very minimum stay neutral in this year's U.S. Senate race in 
New York. But on Monday, Rivera's 150,000-member union, 1199, the 
National Health and Human Service Employees union, endorsed Rep. Charles 
E. Schumer, D-N.Y., and thereby risked D'Amato's wrath. The endorsement 
is risky, labor leaders acknowledge, because angering this powerful 
senator could make him far less responsive to labor's needs when unions 
turn to him for help in the future if he is re-elected. Although it 
may seem illogical, two words go far to explain why Rivera's union 
backed Schumer: Monica Lewinsky. Largely as a result of the Lewinsky 
scandal, Democrats say they suddenly fear that the Republicans will 
gain a filibuster-proof, 60-seat majority in the Senate, where the 
Republicans have 55 seats to the Democrats' 45. For labor leaders 
like Rivera, the notion of a strong Republican majority is a nightmare. 
That fear has helped push other New York unions into Schumer's column, 
even though D'Amato had long courted them. Those unions include the 
teamsters' joint council in New York City and District Council 37, 
an umbrella group representing 120,000 municipal employees. Labor 
leaders say they fear that with a filibuster-proof Republican majority, 
the Senate would push through anti-union legislation, like recently 
defeated Republican proposals to curb labor's political spending and 
cut financing for the National Labor Relations Board. ``We are worried 
about legislation that will not allow the labor movement to survive 
into the next century,'' Rivera said. Alarmed that the Democrats will 
lose Senate seats in California, Illinois, Wisconsin, Nevada and South 
Carolina, Rivera's union concluded that it was worth backing Schumer. 
The decision, Rivera emphasized repeatedly, was not personal but was 
based on national considerations. ``Unfortunately, the leadership 
of the Republican Party at the national level in the person of Newt 
Gingrich and Trent Lott are not necessarily from the same culture 
as the Republicans of the Northeast,'' he said. ``They're far more 
conservative, far more anti-labor, far more anti-worker, far more 
pro-business. We fear that the Democratic Party faces irrelevance 
in the United States Senate if we go below 41 seats.'' Trying to avoid 
a rupture with D'Amato, Rivera praised him as ``an effective senator.'' 
The endorsement could be a boon for Schumer. Rivera's union and the 
teachers' union have labor's strongest political operations in New 
York. In addition, Schumer will get thousands of dollars from the 
local as well as use of its renowned phone banks, which can make 50,000 
political calls a day. A spokesman for D'Amato said, ``Al D'Amato's 
proud that he's been endorsed by over 100 union federations and locals, 
representing more that 400,000 working men and women, and he'll continue 
his efforts on behalf of working middle class families.'' His labor 
endorsements include the New York City Patrolmen's Benevolent Association 
and the New York State Building and Construction Trades Council. Besides 
the backing of 1199, Schumer also received the endorsement of 1199's 
parent union, the Service Employees International Union, which has 
350,000 members in New York State. Rivera _ who did not support D'Amato 
the last time he ran either _ announced the endorsements during the 
founding convention of the New York State Council of the service employees 
union. The convention packed Town Hall, and the new group aims to 
make the service employees a power to be reckoned with by bringing 
together a dozen union locals to forge a common political and legislative 
strategy. Earlier this year, 1199 merged with the service employees, 
and as part of that agreement, Rivera became head of the service employees 
in New York State.

It was not a voice mail message that Dr. Marilyn Rymer, a neurologist 
in Kansas City, Mo., would routinely delete, even as a registered 
Democrat. ``Speaker Newt Gingrich's office,'' it said, was calling 
to discuss a ``national leadership award.'' Dr. Rymer has won acclaim 
as the director of a prominent stroke-treatment center, but this proposition 
seemed particularly grand. When she returned the call, she said she 
was told she would also be named honorary chairman of an elite committee 
to advise Gingrich on legislation. Too good to be true? Well, Dr. 
Rymer would have to pay her own way if the committee should actually 
meet, and as an honorary committee chairman, she discovered, she would 
be a member of a committee composed entirely of honorary chairmen. 
And oh, the speaker wanted a donation of $500 to $1,000 to ``help 
our efforts,'' according to a transcript of a similar chat with another 
doctor, to elect a bigger Republican majority in the House of Representatives. 
With the approach of the midterm elections next month, it turns out 
that the National Republican Congressional Committee, which supports 
candidates for the House, has been sponsoring similar calls to tens 
of thousands of small-business owners, including doctors. With this 
and other fund-raising programs, the committee says it has amassed 
$62 million for the elections. But campaign finance watchdogs say 
the solicitations mark a new departure in political fund raising, 
one they call akin to the practices of marketing companies like the 
Publishers' Clearing House that hook consumers with visions of million-dollar 
windfalls to induce them to subscribe to magazines. By citing the 
speaker and promising celebrity and influence, they say, the calls 
are a bait-and-switch scheme to seize the attention of people who 
might otherwise hang up. Dr. Rymer says she was incensed. So was Dr. 
Stanley Turecki, a child and family psychiatrist in New York who votes 
as an independent and was also called. ``I was absolutely outraged,'' 
he said. ``Anybody else who would do that would fall into the category 
of consumer fraud.'' Kenneth Gross, a Washington lawyer who specializes 
in election law and represents both Democratic and Republican clients, 
said, ``I have never heard of that particular device.'' But it doesn't 
appear illegal, he said, adding, ``It's a fund-raising gimmick to 
get attention.'' Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, a nonprofit, 
nonpartisan advocate of campaign finance reform, said, ``This is a 
new version of caveat emptor _ buyer be damned instead of buyer beware.'' 
When businesses do it, he added, Congress orders investigations. ``But 
this isn't going to be investigated because it's members of Congress 
who are doing it.'' Todd Harris, a spokesman for the National Republican 
Congressional Committee, said that he had not heard of any complaints 
and that there was no intent to deceive. ``The national leadership 
award is a part of what we call donor and member fulfillment,'' Harris 
said. ``It's part of bringing them into the process. It's important 
that they be recognized for the support they give the party.'' ``There's 
no quid pro quo'' that people solicited could receive awards for past 
contributions, he added. What most peeves Drs. Rymer and Turecki is 
the message left with secretaries and answering machines invoking 
Gingrich's ``office'' and proposing the award. They say they envisioned 
a senior aide at a telephone in the speaker's chambers under the Capitol 
Dome. The calls, however, are not placed by aides to Gingrich, by 
any of his offices or by anyone in Washington. They are made by people 
with headsets and computers at the home of InfoCision Management Corp., 
a telemarketing firm and Congressional committee client in Akron, 
Ohio. On its Web page, InfoCision says its 1,400 employees operate 
1,584 telephone lines and 9 phone centers. ``Every word in the script 
is approved by our clients,'' the company says on its Web site. ``Every 
conceivable objection is scripted with a powerful rebuttal.'' Besides 
telemarketing for businesses, said Jamie Blair, a supervisor at the 
center, ``we specialize in helping the Republican Party and conservative 
political groups.'' However far they are from Gingrich, the telemarketers 
are instructed to answer return calls with: ``Republican Congressional 
Committee, Newt Gingrich's office. May I help you?'' A doctor in Kansas 
City, Mo., who is a registered Republican and who declined to be named, 
dialed the Gingrich number (888-484-1644) left on answering machines 
and secretly recorded the ensuing discussion, which is legal in Missouri. 
``We were asked to contact you on behalf of the speaker,'' says a 
woman who picked up the call and identified herself as Nancy. ``He 
is right now aggressively pushing legislation to cut taxes by as much 
as half, and he's also interested in legislation to cut capital gains 
to a single rate of 15 percent.'' To assure passage of the legislation, 
the speaker wants to increase his Republican majority, she says, adding, 
``To help us do that, the speaker is pulling together a group of individuals 
such as yourself and is inviting you to be an honorary chairman on 
his advisory council.'' Nancy continues: ``There will be correspondence 
with the speaker, such as conference calls. It's a great way that 
he can get your input and thoughts on legislation that does concern 
you. Or maybe surveys or questionnaires.'' Later, Nancy says: ``As 
a member of his committee, you would be receiving from the speaker 
our national leadership award, which is really quite an honor. And 
to be honest, he will be asking each of our chairmen if they could 
help our efforts to increase our majority with a one-time contribution 
of $500 or $1,000. ``Now that would be used on the nationwide media 
campaign that Newt has undertaken to target those seats we really 
need. And as someone who I'm sure would also benefit from this, could 
I tell the speaker he could count on your help?'' The doctor demurs. 
``I am a registered, you know, Republican in Kansas,'' she tells Nancy. 
``Probably if I were to do something it would be to go through my 
own representative.'' Then the doctor tries to ascertain where Nancy 
is located. ``Is this congressman Gingrich's office that I'm talking 
to?'' the doctor asks. ``The speaker's office,'' says Nancy. ``This 
is the speaker's office.'' ``That I'm talking to,'' says the doctor, 
double-checking. ``Uh-huh,'' Nancy replies. The law prohibits political 
fund-raising calls from federal offices. Vice President Al Gore is 
under a Justice Department investigation for fund-raising calls he 
allegedly made from his office in the 1996 presidential campaign. 
But the calls can be made from just about anywhere else, including 
campaign offices. Harris said the calls are ``in no way related to 
the speaker's OFFICIAL office.'' He added: ``What is more important 
is not where the calls get routed. People are more interested in an 
award with the speaker's good name on it than whether the call gets 
routed to Washington or Ohio.'' Turecki disagrees. ``I see it as basic 
sleaze,'' he said.

The last time George Voinovich ran for office, he won re-election 
as Ohio's governor with 72 percent of the vote, stunning even his 
most optimistic supporters and setting a 20th-century record for victory 
margins in Ohio politics. This year, Voinovich, a Republican who is 
barred from seeking a third term, is running again, this time for 
the Senate seat held by John Glenn, a Democrat who is retiring. And 
while there are few who expect Voinovich to repeat his electoral benchmark 
of four years ago, politicians of both parties generally acknowledge 
that he is well positioned to increase the Republican majority in 
the Senate. That has not prevented Voinovich's Democratic opponent, 
Mary Boyle, from undertaking a vigorous campaign. Ms. Boyle, a former 
commissioner in Cuyahoga County, which encompasses Cleveland, is crisscrossing 
the nation's seventh-most populous state in what she describes as 
a grass-roots campaign that, while operating on a comparative shoestring, 
has nonetheless attracted to her side nationally known Democrats _ 
President Clinton foremost among them _ on the campaign trail. Glenn, 
the former astronaut who is preparing to return to space this month 
at the age of 77, has not made an endorsement in the Senate race. 
Like many candidates this year, Ms. Boyle, 55, is campaigning hard 
on the issue of education, seeking to portray Voinovich, 61, as a 
lackluster steward who allowed the state's schools to decline. ``He 
promised to be the education governor,'' said Ms. Boyle. ``But after 
seven and a half years he has failed the students of this state.'' 
Her role in the campaign, she said, ``is to remind the people of the 
state of Ohio that George Voinovich made a promise and that he didn't 
deliver on it.'' Specifically, she discusses a decision last year 
by the Ohio Supreme Court that cited wide disparities in the quality 
of the state's schools and ruled unconstitutional the formula for 
funding them. She has also attacked her Republican opponent for supporting 
a proposal to raise the state's sales tax by one percent. Under that 
plan, half the additional funds would have been used for school improvement 
with the remainder earmarked for reducing property taxes. That statewide 
ballot initiative last May proved to be wildly unpopular, with about 
80 percent of the voters opposing it. While the topics of taxes and 
education are hot ones this political season in Ohio, it is not clear 
that Ms. Boyle's emphasis on them has helped her campaign. Despite 
some narrowing in the opinion polls, she is still trailing Voinovich 
by 10 percentage points in some polls and as much as 18 points in 
others. There is also a sharp fund-raising disparity. Ms. Boyle, who 
is running her first statewide race and has widespread union support, 
has raised nearly $2 million so far, far less than the nearly $7 million 
Voinovich has taken in. Also, Voinovich, a former lieutenant governor, 
has been on statewide ballots five times over the last 20 years and 
thus is the better-known candidate. The electoral dynamics of Ohio 
are also aiding Voinovich. The northern half of the state, with its 
history of industrial, unionized cities, has a tradition of voting 
largely for Democratic candidates, while the southern tier of the 
state is considered more conservative and typically leans Republican. 
But Voinovich and Ms. Boyle share the same home terrain, depriving 
Ms. Boyle of the geographic advantage that often accompanies Democratic 
candidates. Indeed, as a boy, Voinovich once delivered newspapers 
to the Boyle home in the working-class Collinwood section of Cleveland. 
And Voinovich, a former mayor of Cleveland, has developed a reputation 
as a moderate Republican who works well with Democrats. Voinovich, 
while campaigning vigorously himself, is keeping a full schedule of 
official duties, assuming the role of the experienced, elected official. 
``If I get into the Senate, I will probably know more about domestic 
policy than any member of the Senate,'' he said in an interview on 
Wednesday in Canton, sandwiched between a ribbon-cutting ceremony 
and a fund-raising reception at a vacuum cleaner museum. ``As mayor, 
I had my nose rubbed into the problems of urban America and was fairly 
successful in dealing with them. And, as governor, I have dealt with 
the problems of Medicaid, welfare and education. I'm the only person 
in the United States who has been president of the National League 
of Cities and chairman of the National Governors Association.'' To 
his opponent's charges on his record on education, Voinovich is dismissive. 
``I'm probably the only Republican in the United States who has been 
endorsed by the Ohio Education Association and National Education 
Association,'' he said, adding that Ms. Boyle was a member of the 
state Legislature during the period cited in the Supreme Court ruling. 
``Mary Boyle was vice chairman of the Ways and Means Committee and 
a member of the Democratic leadership during those years,'' Voinovich 
said. ``They did nothing to fix the buildings, they did nothing for 
technology and the urban school districts.'' Ms. Boyle, who has not 
yet begun to run campaign commercials on television, said her status 
as the underdog had ``allowed me to be more focused, more intense.'' 
Pausing after a campaign fund-raising breakfast with former Democratic 
Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey here on Wednesday, Ms. Boyle said: 
``This has been a marathon and it's been pretty much uphill. But now, 
we're down to the last three miles. It's a tough race.''

by 15 percentage points in some polls and as much as 20 points in 
others. There is also a sharp fund-raising disparity. Ms. Boyle, who 
is running her first statewide race and has widespread union support, 
has raised nearly $2 million so far, far less than the nearly $7 million 
Voinovich has taken in. Also, Voinovich, a former lieutenant governor, 
has been on statewide ballots five times over the last 20 years and 
thus is the better-known candidate. The electoral dynamics of Ohio 
are also aiding Voinovich. The northern half of the state, with its 
history of industrial, unionized cities, has a tradition of voting 
largely for Democratic candidates, while the southern tier of the 
state is considered more conservative and typically leans Republican. 
But Voinovich and Ms. Boyle share the same home terrain, depriving 
Ms. Boyle of the geographic advantage that often accompanies Democratic 
candidates. Indeed, as a boy, Voinovich once delivered newspapers 
to the Boyle home in the working-class Collinwood section of Cleveland. 
And Voinovich, a former mayor of Cleveland, has developed a reputation 
as a moderate Republican who works well with Democrats. Voinovich, 
while campaigning vigorously himself, is keeping a full schedule of 
official duties, assuming the role of the experienced, elected official. 
``If I get into the Senate, I will probably know more about domestic 
policy than any member of the Senate,'' he said in an interview on 
Wednesday in Canton, sandwiched between a ribbon-cutting ceremony 
and a fund-raising reception at a vacuum cleaner museum. ``As mayor, 
I had my nose rubbed into the problems of urban America and was fairly 
successful in dealing with them. And, as governor, I have dealt with 
the problems of Medicaid, welfare and education. I'm the only person 
in the United States who has been president of the National League 
of Cities and chairman of the National Governors Association.'' To 
his opponent's charges on his record on education, Voinovich is dismissive. 
``I'm probably the only Republican in the United States who has been 
endorsed by the Ohio Education Association and National Education 
Association,'' he said, adding that Ms. Boyle was a member of the 
state Legislature during the period cited in the Supreme Court ruling. 
``Mary Boyle was vice chairman of the Ways and Means Committee and 
a member of the Democratic leadership during those years,'' Voinovich 
said. ``They did nothing to fix the buildings, they did nothing for 
technology and the urban school districts.'' Ms. Boyle, who has not 
yet begun to run campaign commercials on television, said her status 
as the underdog had ``allowed me to be more focused, more intense.'' 
Pausing after a campaign fund-raising breakfast with former Democratic 
Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey here on Wednesday, Ms. Boyle said: 
``This has been a marathon and it's been pretty much uphill. But now, 
we're down to the last three miles. It's a tough race.''

Nearly 60 years behind the times, the House voted Friday to condemn 
the Nazi-Soviet nonaggression pact of 1939. The measure, a nonbinding 
resolution, was brought to the floor by Rep. John Shimkus, R-Ill. 
He is of Lithuanian descent, has a pocket of Lithuanians in his hometown 
of Collinsville and wants to try to highlight his support for the 
Baltic states' past efforts against Soviet repression. Shimkus' measure 
is an example of how members of Congress are spending their time as 
they stand idle and wait for Republican leaders to reach agreement 
on spending bills with the White House, thus avoiding a government 
shutdown and allowing them to go home and campaign for the November 
elections. With time on their hands, many Republicans are using the 
House floor as their personal stage to elicit votes on topics that 
they can boast about to the folks back home. Most of these matters 
have little chance of finding their way into law, but members hope 
to turn them to their advantage on Election Day. There are plenty 
of other items whose sponsors hope will not attract attention. These 
tend to be special-interest matters that members hope will escape 
scrutiny in the rush to leave town. The sponsors of these measures 
now have the added advantage of the impeachment inquiry, which has 
been preoccupying Congress, the news media and the public and giving 
them cover to move their pet causes quietly into the gigantic omnibus 
package that Congress will eventually present to Clinton for signing. 
These quieter measures include one proposed by Mississippi's two senators, 
Trent Lott and Thad Cochran, both Republicans. They want agriculture 
export credits to buy chickens for Russia, which has bought the chickens 
but cannot pay for them. The chickens are from Mississippi. Democrats 
have little influence in the Republican-controlled Congress. But some 
Democrats are close enough to Republican leaders, and to Republican 
goals, that their measures are taken seriously. These include Rep. 
John Murtha, D-Pa., the ranking Democrat on the national security 
subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee, who is pushing a measure 
to increase military pensions. Perhaps the best example of an attempt 
to force a vote for political advantage is a measure that would require 
minors to notify their parents if they are seeking contraceptives 
from federally funded family planning clinics. House leaders allowed 
the measure to be brought to the floor as a way to appease the more 
conservative members, who believe they have been shortchanged by the 
budget process. It passed the House by a vote of 224-200 but has almost 
no chance of becoming law. The Senate does not plan to take it up, 
and Clinton would almost certainly veto it. But Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., 
said that votes like these were important because they put their sponsors' 
ideological foes on the record as opposing something that sounds reasonable, 
and that opposition can be used against them in the Nov. 3 election. 
 NYT19981010.0027 
Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, the New York Republican who is running for re-election, 
went to Manhattan's Grand Central Terminal the other morning to accept 
an award from mass-transit advocates. But the reporters who had gathered 
there showed little interest in the shiny train car at the senator's 
back. Instead, they repeatedly asked him how he would vote on an impeachment 
of President Clinton. ``Look, I'm not going to make any comment with 
respect to that subject matter,'' D'Amato responded. ``I am not just 
a citizen. I am a citizen-senator who may be called upon to make a 
decision.'' But D'Amato is something else as well: a candidate in 
what may be the tightest Senate race in the nation. And variations 
of his elliptical response can be heard in Senate races around the 
country, where both Republicans and Democrats are encountering similar 
questions. All of which suggests that after the House voted Thursday 
to authorize an impeachment inquiry, this year's 34 races for the 
U.S. Senate have become, beyond what they already were, the electoral 
equivalent of jury selection. If the House votes to impeach Clinton, 
the matter goes to the Senate, which must decide by a two-thirds majority 
whether to convict him and, thus, remove him from office. As a result, 
the Monica Lewinsky matter has suddenly injected a new disruptive 
force into the Senate contests. Voters, even those who support Clinton, 
expect their political leaders, Republican or Democratic, to renounce 
Clinton's behavior, and candidates have been doing that. But impeachment 
is another matter; most polls show the nation is against it. The danger 
for Senate candidates is that with impeachment now a real possibility, 
the debate may move beyond the president's behavior _ about which 
there is little disagreement _ to the more problematic issue of whether 
he should be removed from office. For most of the strategists involved 
in the races, there is little guidance on how to handle the impeachment 
issue. Advisers to candidates of both parties said in interviews last 
week that they were perplexed and worried, unsure what they can or 
should do on the issue to gain the advantage _ or guard against harm. 
``I can't tell how this one is going to go,'' said Mike Russell, a 
spokesman for the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee. ``This 
is a very surreal environment.'' Of the 34 Senate seats in play, 18 
are held by Democrats and 16 by Republicans, who now hold 55 seats 
in all. Republicans would have to win 28 of the 34 races to produce 
the 67 votes necessary for conviction, assuming such a vote were to 
go along party lines. Only an electoral catastrophe for the Democrats, 
which seems almost unthinkable, could produce such a huge loss. Jennifer 
Duffy, who follows Senate races for the Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan 
newsletter, said that so far, at least, none of the Senate candidates 
has made an explicit appeal for votes based on how they would vote 
on a presidential jury. But she and others are wondering if this may 
be about to change. This is difficult ground to measure. One of the 
central questions of this political year has been how Clinton's dealings 
with Ms. Lewinsky might affect turnout. For a long time, politicians 
assumed that dispirited Democrats would stay home as a rebuke to Clinton, 
just as many Republicans did in November 1974, three months after 
President Richard M. Nixon resigned. But now some analysts wonder 
if the partisan fight in Congress last week might have the opposite 
effect among some Democrats. ``That's the problem,'' said Stuart Rothenberg, 
the editor of an independent political newsletter in Washington. ``It's 
not that we don't know, and that the politicians don't know, where 
the general public stands on impeachment. The problem is that we don't 
know where the electorate stands on impeachment.'' And asking voters 
to think ahead to an impeachment proceeding as they cast their ballots 
in a Senate race is, in the words of Stuart Stevens, a Republican 
consultant, ``a double bank-shot.'' Such strategies, he said, tend 
to work only with a small number of single-minded or sophisticated 
voters. Against that complicated backdrop, the prevailing thinking 
is that the use of the impeachment issue will vary from race to race, 
state to state and week to week, depending on the circumstances of 
the candidates and the composition of the electorate. If Democrats 
try to turn the image of Clinton in the dock to their advantage, it 
would be in states with a Democratic edge or with sizable numbers 
of black voters, who overwhelmingly support the president. In contests 
like those, it might well prove to be in the interest of a Democratic 
candidate to, as one consultant put it, sit down in front of a camera 
and tape an advertisement in which the candidate denounces the president's 
behavior but solemnly pledges to vote against impeachment. Strategists 
in both parties believe that kind of approach could prove effective. 
``This is an issue where there is a huge disconnect between the elites 
and the public,'' said Fred Yang, a Democratic consultant with clients 
in Wisconsin and the Carolinas. That kind of Democratic strategy might 
emerge in California, New York, Illinois, Wisconsin, Washington and 
perhaps Arkansas. By contrast, Democrats in South Carolina, Georgia 
and Nevada would be less likely to oppose Clinton's impeachment. On 
the other side, Republican consultants are telling their candidates 
to stress Clinton's misdeeds and stay away from talk of impeachment. 
The last thing the party wants is to turn the Senate elections into 
a referendum on whether Clinton should be forced from office. ``The 
White House might think from the overall public numbers that maybe 
they would like to make this a referendum election,'' said Ed Goeas, 
a Republican pollster who is working in Senate races this year. ``Republicans 
certainly aren't going to let that happen.'' D'Amato responded to 
questions about Clinton with the language that Republican consultants 
have been suggesting to their candidates. ``When and if that matter 
comes to the Senate, I will decide on the facts that are presented 
to me at that time,'' D'Amato said. ``It would be very premature for 
me to suggest any course of action without it being referred. Because, 
indeed, we may be called upon to act as a jury of some kind.'' But 
Schumer, a member of the House Judiciary Committee, which is conducting 
the impeachment investigation, virtually embraced the issue. In a 
live telecast of the hearings, he said the president deserved a lesser 
punishment, such as censure or reprimand. And Schumer plans to campaign 
in New York on Monday with Clinton at his side. Schumer's media adviser, 
Hank Morris, seemed to suggest last week that impeachment will grow 
as an issue. ``Senator D'Amato claims he does not want to share his 
opinion with the people of New York,'' Morris said. ``And if he doesn't 
have an opinion, he's the only New Yorker who doesn't have an opinion.'' 
Asked if Schumer would raise the issue in a television commercial, 
Morris responded: ``We don't talk about what we're going to do. I 
wouldn't rule it in and I wouldn't rule it out.''

White House officials and gay Democrats, concerned that the nation's 
largest gay and lesbian political organization is about to endorse 
Sen. Alfonse D'Amato for re-election, are intensely lobbying the group 
to try to shift its support to the Democratic challenger, Rep. Charles 
Schumer. Publicly, officials in the organization, the Human Rights 
Campaign, said they were still deliberating their position in the 
closely watched race, considered among the tightest in the nation. 
They said they would probably make an endorsement by Friday. But privately, 
organization officials and gay activists from both parties who have 
been monitoring the debate say the group is most likely to endorse 
D'Amato, a Republican seeking his fourth term. They also raised the 
possibility that the group would endorse both candidates, or remain 
neutral. If the group endorses D'Amato, said officials who spoke on 
the condition of anonymity, the endorsement would be based on three 
major factors: The group tends to favor incumbents, has been searching 
for allies among the Senate Republican majority and considers D'Amato's 
recent record on gay issues to be quite strong. An endorsement by 
the group, which is held in high regard by many gay and lesbian voters, 
could prove important in swinging voters to D'Amato in a tight race. 
It would also be a major symbolic victory for the senator, who has 
sought to recast himself as a centrist in recent years and could use 
the endorsement to build his standing among moderate swing voters. 
A D'Amato endorsement would also weaken Schumer's efforts to portray 
the incumbent as a right-wing extremist and would signify to many 
voters a fraying of the traditional Democratic coalition that has 
included black and gay voters, women and labor unions. The intensity 
of the debate surrounding the endorsement underscores the importance 
of the New York Senate race to Democrats across the nation, who see 
defeating D'Amato as one of their best opportunities to prevent the 
Republicans from gaining 60 seats in the Senate _ enough to stop a 
Democratic filibuster. The Republicans currently hold a 55-to-45 majority. 
``There is sentiment in the community that if the Republicans get 
60 votes, that Trent Lott will basically be in charge politically 
for the next two years,'' said David Mixner, a close friend of President 
Clinton's who is gay. He was referring to the Senate majority leader, 
who has called homosexuality a sin and likened it to kleptomania. 
Saturday, Schumer picked up his own endorsement from New York's largest 
gay and lesbian political organization, the Empire State Pride Agenda. 
Although the Human Rights Campaign is bipartisan, it has been very 
close to the Clinton administration, has many Democrats on its board 
and receives much of its money from Democratic contributors. Largely 
because of the group's strong Democratic ties, gay Democrats, New 
York liberals and White House officials are infuriated that it is 
even considering endorsing D'Amato, who also runs on the Right to 
Life and Conservative Party lines and often receives high ratings 
from the Christian Coalition, which typically opposes legislation 
on civil rights for gay people. Although the organization has been 
thought to be inching toward a D'Amato endorsement for months, the 
lobbying campaign for Schumer has picked up intensity in the last 
two weeks, driven partly by a growing sense that the race is now closer 
than ever. Democrats and advocates in both parties who support rights 
for gay people said that Vice President Al Gore, Hillary Rodham Clinton 
and Secretary for Health and Human Services Donna Shalala have made 
personal appeals to Human Rights Campaign officials urging them not 
to endorse D'Amato. White House officials said they did not know whether 
the three had made such appeals, and Human Rights Campaign officials 
declined to comment. Schumer met privately with the group's top officials 
last week to make one last pitch for the endorsement. Clinton administration 
officials have also been buttonholing the group's board members at 
every opportunity, from cocktail parties to fund-raisers, raising 
concerns about a D'Amato endorsement. Some New York advocates of civil 
rights for gay people have flooded the organization with phone calls, 
e-mail messages and letters. Democratic officials have been encouraging 
the group's major donors to express their opposition to D'Amato. People 
involved in the lobbying efforts said that at best, they are hoping 
the group will endorse both candidates, or make no endorsement at 
all. ``Chuck Schumer has been a strong supporter of issues that are 
important to gay communities,'' said a senior White House official 
who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``The last thing that they 
should want to do is hurt the candidacy of someone who has been so 
supportive of their agenda.'' The Human Rights Campaign is considered 
the most influential gay and lesbian organization in Washington, with 
a national membership of 250,000 and an annual budget of more than 
$13 million. The group was created in the early 1980s in large part 
to counter the rise of the Christian right and Ronald Reagan. Paradoxically, 
D'Amato was first elected in the Reagan landslide of 1980 and remained 
a strong supporter of President Reagan. For D'Amato, who has aggressively 
courted gay voters, the endorsement would represent a crowning achievement 
in his efforts to reposition himself as a moderate. Since 1993, the 
senator has backed the right of gay citizens to serve in the military, 
sponsored legislation to prevent job discrimination against gay workers 
and opposed his own leadership's attempts to block the nominations 
of two openly gay men to positions in the Clinton administration. 
To gay supporters of D'Amato, an endorsement by the Human Rights Campaign 
would signify the political maturation of the gay electorate and help 
the organization insulate itself from accusations that it is too close 
to the Democratic Party. Those who support a D'Amato endorsement, 
including top officials within the Human Rights Campaign, contend 
that in the current political climate, where Congress is almost certain 
to remain under Republican control after November, gay people must 
build alliances with moderate Republicans. Human Rights Campaign officials 
also say their standing policy is to support friendly incumbents, 
even when their challengers have better voting records on gay issues. 
That is the case in New York, where Schumer's rating by the Human 
Rights Campaign has been consistently better than D'Amato's. Both 
men, however, have angered advocates of rights for gay people by voting 
for legislation that allows states to not recognize gay marriages. 
In a precedent widely cited by D'Amato supporters, the organization 
endorsed Sen. John F. Kerry, a Democrat, over the Republican challenger, 
William Weld, in the 1996 Massachusetts Senate race, even though Weld's 
record on gay rights was considered stronger. The move angered gay 
Republicans, who now contend that snubbing D'Amato would prove that 
the group is biased toward Democrats. But there is clearly a large 
number of Human Rights Campaign contributors and board members who 
strongly feel that endorsing D'Amato will permanently damage the group, 
particularly among women. They fear that abortion rights supporters 
will quit the group in droves because D'Amato has never wavered in 
his opposition to abortion during 18 years in Congress. Many New York 
gay activists would also be deeply upset if the group endorses D'Amato, 
whom they blame for installing the state Senate majority leader, Joseph 
Bruno, whom they consider to be strongly anti-gay. Matt Foreman, executive 
director of the Empire State Pride Agenda, cited D'Amato's role as 
``the architect'' of the state Republican Party as a major reason 
the group endorsed Schumer. ``While he has criticized fellow Republicans 
in Washington for their intolerance, here at home, his own party's 
blatant discrimination is still the order of the day,'' Foreman said. 
For that reason, some White House officials say they think a Human 
Rights Campaign endorsement of D'Amato will be almost meaningless 
among gay voters. They contend that it might even hurt the senator 
among his conservative base. ``I don't think anybody will vote for 
Al D'Amato because of an HRC endorsement,'' said a White House aide 
who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``But I think some people 
in the Right to Life Party and some upstate people are going to say, 
`Who is this guy and why should we vote for him?'''
