Yugoslavia must cooperate with the U.N. war crimes tribunal investigating 
alleged atrocities during the wars in Croatia and Bosnia, international 
legal experts meeting in Belgrade said Sunday. The meeting was the 
first international debate in Yugoslavia over the U.N. tribunal's 
work and the government's cooperation with it. The tribunal, established 
by the U.N. Security Council in 1993, sits in The Hague, Netherlands. 
Despite objections to the tribunal, Yugoslav authorities allowed the 
two-day discussions _ organized by the Belgrade-based, non-governmental 
Humanitarian Law Center _ to take place without any problems. State-run 
media largely ignored the event. Though there were some disagreements, 
participants in the discussions generally agreed that crimes against 
humanity cannot go unpunished. ``The indicted who are not in The Hague 
are at-large because of the refusal by Croatian and Yugoslav authorities 
to arrest and extradite them,'' said Mark Ellis, a lawyer and representative 
of the American Bar Association. Present-day Yugoslavia, consisting 
of Serbia and Montenegro, cooperates with the tribunal in cases where 
Serbs were the victims in Bosnia and Croatia, the two former republics 
that fought wars for their secession. But Yugoslavia has questioned 
the tribunal's jurisdiction and refuses to indict three army officers 
wanted for alleged war crimes in Croatia. Last week, it also refused 
to allow U.N. investigators to probe alleged atrocities in Serbia's 
southern Kosovo province where ethnic Albanian separatists are fighting 
government forces. ``The tribunal was founded to satanize Serbs,'' 
said Miodrag Mitic, a former legal adviser in Yugoslavia's foreign 
ministry. He said the U.N. court was influenced by powerful countries 
that dominate the international body. On Saturday, David Scheffer, 
the U.S. State Department's ambassador at-large for war crimes, demanded 
Yugoslavia's full cooperation.

The president of the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal harshly criticized 
Belgrade authorities anew for refusing to let U.N. investigators probe 
alleged atrocities in Kosovo. In a letter to the United Nations Security 
Council released Wednesday by the tribunal, presiding judge Gabrielle 
Kirk McDonald of the United States said the failure of Yugoslav officials 
to grant visas to investigators is ``an affront.'' ``The intentional 
and continuous refusal by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to comply 
with its clear and incontrovertible legal obligations to the tribunal 
is an affront to the Security Council and all law-abiding nations,'' 
she said. The Texas judge fired off the letter last Friday following 
the refusal of Belgrade authorities to allow tribunal Chief Prosecutor 
Louise Arbour of Canada and a team of investigators to visit Kosovo. 
McDonald asked the Security Council to impose ``measures which are 
sufficiently compelling to bring the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia 
into the fold of law-abiding nations.'' Hundreds of people, mostly 
ethnic Albanians, have been killed, and as many as 300,000 driven 
from their homes since February, when Serb forces began a crackdown 
on ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo. The tribunal wants to look 
into allegations of war crimes on both sides of the conflict.

The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal Monday acquitted a Muslim military 
commander of war crimes against Bosnian Serb prisoners in 1992, but 
convicted three underlings in the first U.N. case dealing with anti-Serb 
atrocities. The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal cleared Zejnil Delalic, 
a Muslim, of responsibility for war crimes committed against Serb 
captives at a Bosnian government-run prison camp under his command. 
Prosecutor Grant Niemann said he would appeal Delalic's acquittal, 
and asked judges to keep him in custody pending the outcome of the 
appeal. The U.N. court convicted camp commander Zdravko Mucic, a Croat, 
of 11 war crimes and grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions because 
he oversaw guards who murdered nine Serbs and tortured six. Mucic 
smiled as he heard his sentence of seven years in prison read out. 
His conviction was the first by an international court on the basis 
of so-called ``command responsibility'' since post-World War II tribunals 
convicted Nazi and Japanese superiors for the crimes of their subordinates. 
``Mr. Mucic was clearly derelict in his duty and allowed those under 
his authority to commit the most heinous of offenses, without taking 
any disciplinary action,'' said presiding Judge Adolphus Karibi-Whyte. 
Hazim Delic, a Muslim who served as Mucic's deputy, was found guilty 
of two murders and of raping two women as well as torturing other 
inmates. He was sentenced to 20 years. Esad Landzo, a Muslim guard, 
was convicted of three murders and the torture of at least three other 
inmates. He was jailed for 15 years. All four defendants had faced 
up to life imprisonment, the maximum punishment at the tribunal, which 
has no death penalty. Monday's verdicts ended a marathon 20-month 
trial that focused on the brutal mistreatment of the Bosnian Serbs, 
themselves blamed for the vast majority of the conflict's war crimes. 
During the trial _ the tribunal's longest to date involving 122 witnesses 
_ survivors described the campaign of terror unleashed against Serbs 
in the area. Inmates at the Celebici prison camp were beaten to death 
by guards wielding baseball bats, wooden planks and rifle butts, according 
to testimony. Others were set on fire, raped and forced to commit 
sexual acts with members of their own family. The 49-page indictment 
detailing atrocities at Celebici asserts that at least 14 prisoners 
were killed in 1992. One prisoner was beaten to death and had a Muslim 
party badge nailed to his head, a witness claimed. Yet a few witnesses 
also praised Delalic and Mucic for humanitarian gestures, such as 
getting food and clothing to some prisoners and releasing others. 
The tribunal, set up by the Security Council in 1993, has convicted 
only one other person following a trial _ Bosnian Serb Dusan Tadic, 
who was sentenced in May 1997 to 20 years for killing and torturing 
Muslims in 1992. Two other men have confessed to killing Muslims, 
handing the tribunal two more convictions while sparing it the need 
for trials.

The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal Monday acquitted a Muslim commander 
of war crimes against Bosnian Serb prisoners in 1992, but convicted 
three underlings in the first U.N. case dealing with anti-Serb atrocities.

In its first case to deal with atrocities against Serbs during Bosnia's 
civil war, a U.N. war crimes tribunal on Monday convicted three prison 
officials and guards, but acquitted a top military commander who oversaw 
the facility. The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal cleared Cmndr. Zejnil 
Delalic, of the Bosnian Muslim Army, of responsibility for war crimes 
committed at a government-run prison camp under his overall command. 
Prosecutor Grant Niemann of Australia said he would appeal Delalic's 
acquittal. Judges freed Delalic pending the outcome of the appeal. 
``Let me thank you for a just and fair judgment,'' Delalic told the 
court. ``The judgment has even increased my trust in this institution.'' 
The tribunal convicted camp warden Zdravko Mucic, a Croat, of 11 war 
crimes and grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions because he oversaw 
guards who murdered nine Serbs and tortured six. Mucic, wearing dark 
sunglasses and a cross, smiled as he heard his sentence of seven years 
in prison. Tribunal Deputy Prosecutor Graham Blewitt of Australia 
said he was considering appealing Mucic's ``inadequate'' sentence. 
Mucic's conviction was the first by an international court on the 
basis of ``command responsibility'' since post-World War II tribunals 
convicted Nazi and Japanese superiors for the crimes of their subordinates. 
``Mr. Mucic was clearly derelict in his duty and allowed those under 
his authority to commit the most heinous of offenses, without taking 
any disciplinary action,'' said presiding Judge Adolphus Karibi-Whyte 
of Nigeria. Monday's verdicts ended a marathon 20-month trial that 
focused on the brutal mistreatment of the Bosnian Serbs, themselves 
blamed for the vast majority of war crimes committed during the 3 
1/2-year Bosnian conflict. During the trial _ the tribunal's longest 
to date involving 122 witnesses _ survivors described the campaign 
of terror unleashed against Serbs in the area. Inmates at the Celebici 
prison camp were beaten to death by guards wielding baseball bats, 
wooden planks and rifle butts, according to testimony. Others were 
set on fire, raped and forced to commit sexual acts with members of 
their own family. The 49-page indictment detailing atrocities at Celebici 
asserts that at least 14 prisoners were killed in 1992. One prisoner 
was beaten to death and had a Muslim party badge nailed to his head, 
a witness claimed. Yet a few witnesses also praised Delalic and Mucic, 
for humanitarian gestures, such as getting food and clothing to some 
prisoners and releasing others. Hazim Delic, a Muslim who served as 
deputy warden of the camp, was found guilty of two murders and of 
raping two women as well as torturing other inmates. He was sentenced 
to 20 years by Karibi-Whyte, who denounced rape as ``a despicable 
act which strikes at the very core of human dignity and physical integrity.'' 
Delic's defense attorney said he would likely appeal. Esad Landzo, 
a Muslim guard, was convicted of killing three prisoners and torturing 
at least three others and was sentenced to 15 years. His attorneys 
also are likely to appeal the conviction. All four defendants had 
faced up to life imprisonment, the maximum punishment at the tribunal, 
which has no death penalty. A charge against Delic and Mucic of plundering 
property was dismissed by the three-judge panel. Mucic also was cleared 
of responsibility for four murders and three cases of mistreatment 
or torture of prisoners. Delic was cleared of two murders, and of 
command responsibility for other killings at Celebici. He was also 
acquitted of three cases of torture. Landzo was cleared of one murder 
charge and one torture count. The tribunal, set up by the Security 
Council in 1993, has convicted only one other person following a trial 
_ Bosnian Serb Dusan Tadic, who was sentenced in May 1997 to 20 years 
for killing and torturing Muslims in 1992. Two other men have confessed 
to killing Muslims, handing the tribunal two more convictions without 
conduction trials.

Hundreds of people gathered at Sarajevo airport on Saturday to welcome 
Zejnil Delalic, who was cleared of war crimes charges earlier this 
week after spending 980 days in jail of the international war crimes 
tribunal in The Hague. Delalic, a Muslim, was cleared of charges of 
war crimes committed in 1992 against Serb prisoners in the Muslim-led 
Bosnian Army prison camp Celebici near his hometown of Konjic. Three 
others involved in the same case were convicted and will serve prison 
terms at The Hague for crimes committed as camp guards. Delalic held 
up his verdict as he arrived and was first greeted by his family and 
then by many friends from Konjic, 50 kilometers (31 miles) south of 
Sarajevo, where a huge welcome party for him was planned. ``This is 
the book of 500 pages in which it says 12 times Delalic is not guilty,'' 
he told reporters. ``More important is that acts commited by some 
weren't ordered by officers of our Bosnian Army. These acts were qualified 
as acts of individuals that happened on a daily basis,'' he said. 
Edina Residovic, Delalic's lawyer, said she will seek compensation 
for wrongful imprisonment on behalf of Delalic, who spent almost three 
years in confinement.

He called himself the ``Serb Adolf,'' and his crimes were as chilling 
as his nickname. In a trial opening Monday at the Yugoslav war crimes 
tribunal, U.N. prosecutors were seeking to convince a three-judge 
panel that Goran Jelisic is guilty of genocide, the court's most serious 
offense. The 30-year-old former Bosnian Serb mechanic confessed in 
October to murdering 12 Muslims and Croats in 1992, astonishing many 
observers by reversing his earlier declarations of innocence. Although 
his guilty pleas mean an automatic conviction for war crimes and crimes 
against humanity _ and the likelihood of a maximum life sentence _ 
Jelisic has denied that the killing spree constituted genocide. By 
pressing on with a genocide trial, prosecutors will be able to call 
evidence about the background of Jelisic's murders, including the 
involvement of more senior Serbs. The trial also will give survivors 
of his ruthless campaign a chance to tell their story in court. To 
convict Jelisic of genocide, prosecutors must prove that the murders 
_ most of them carried out with close-range shots from an automatic 
pistol _ were part of a campaign intended to wipe out an entire ethnic 
group in the northern Bosnian town of Brcko. Jelisic, who was arrested 
in January by U.S. troops serving in the NATO force in Bosnia, has 
pleaded guilty to a total of 31 counts of war crimes and crimes against 
humanity. The charges cover the murders as well as three beatings 
and the plundering of property. In entering those guilty pleas, Jelisic 
told the tribunal he wanted to ``cleanse my soul.'' He will officially 
be convicted of those charges during the genocide trial. Jelisic's 
victims were killed in or near the Serb-run Luka prison camp, a former 
port complex on the banks of the Sava River. Although most victims 
were men, Jelisic also clubbed one female inmate with a police baton 
and then fatally shot her. U.N. prosecutors say Jelisic identified 
himself to prisoners as the ``Serb Adolf,'' a reference to Hitler, 
and bragged about the number of Muslims he had killed. Set up in 1993, 
the U.N. court has convicted three Muslims, two Bosnian Croats and 
a Bosnian Serb of war crimes including murder, rape and torture, but 
it has yet to register a genocide conviction. An earlier genocide 
trial was halted when the defendant, Bosnian Serb Milan Kovacevic, 
died of a ruptured artery in his tribunal cell. 
 APW19981130.0803 
To his Muslim targets, Bosnian Serb Goran Jelisic was ``the face of 
genocide'' who once bragged that ``he had to kill 20 or 30 Muslims 
before his morning coffee.'' Opening a genocide trial Monday at the 
Yugoslav war crimes tribunal, U.N. prosecutor Terree Bowers said the 
30-year-old mechanic used the nickname Adolf ``with a perverse pride 
in the genocidal symbolism it represented.'' Jelisic pleaded guilty 
in October to murdering 12 Muslims and Croats in and around the Serb-run 
Luka camp set up in Brcko, northern Bosnia, in May 1992. By trying 
him for genocide, prosecutors will be able to call evidence about 
the background of Jelisic's murders, including the involvement of 
more senior Serbs. The trial also will give survivors of his killing 
spree chance to tell their story in court. Bowers told a three-judge 
tribunal panel that Jelisic admitted in interviews with investigators 
to far more killings than the dozen to which he has pleaded guilty. 
Jelisic will be convicted of those murders and sentenced at the end 
of his trial, which is expected to last well into 1999. He faces a 
maximum sentence of life imprisonment. ``We will never be able to 
fix the exact number'' of victims, Bowers said. ``But if we are to 
believe even a small percentage of the totals which Goran Jelisic 
claimed, then his victims certainly number well over 100.'' As the 
trial began, judges were read excerpts of a psychological report which 
stated that Jelisic was mentally fit to stand trial but suffered a 
``borderline personality disorder.'' Wearing a striped sweater and 
black jeans, Jelisic brought a laptop computer into court and took 
notes. When he wasn't writing, Jelisic sat slightly slumped in his 
chair, his head still, looking impassively around the courtroom. Jelisic's 
campaign of murder stands out _ even at a tribunal set up to deal 
exclusively with atrocities _ for its cold-bloodedness. ``Once Goran 
Jelisic even declined assistance from a guard, noting that he was 
still in `good form' even though he had killed over 60 people,'' Bowers 
told judges, citing statements made by witnesses due to testify later 
in the trial. ``To victims in Brcko, the face of genocide was the 
face of Goran Jelisic,'' he said. Bowers told the judges that Jelisic, 
who held no official rank, was released by Bosnian Serb authorities 
from jail, where he was serving three years for fraud, and sent to 
Brcko to murder Muslims. He told investigators that on his arrival 
in the town, which was of strategic importance to Bosnian Serbs, he 
was given a list of Muslim targets and ordered to kill as many as 
possible. Jelisic, Bowers said, seemed to relish the task. ``Witness 
testimony will also establish that Goran Jelisic was not a reluctant 
tool of the genocide who was being compelled by Serb authorities to 
act against his will,'' the U.S. prosecutor said. ``Quite to the contrary, 
the testimony will firmly establish that Goran Jelisic was an efficient 
and enthusiastic participant in the genocide.'' Set up in 1993, the 
U.N. court has convicted two Muslims, two Bosnian Croats and a Bosnian 
Serb of war crimes including murder, rape and torture, but it has 
yet to register a genocide conviction. An earlier genocide trial was 
halted when the defendant, Bosnian Serb Milan Kovacevic, died of a 
ruptured artery in his tribunal cell.

Some of the closest combat in the half year of the Kosovo conflict, 
to the point of fighting room to room and floor to floor, occurred 
near this village six weeks ago, in the days before 21 women, children 
and elderly members of the Delijaj clan were massacred by Serbian 
forces, their mutilated bodies left strewn on the forest floor. Piecing 
together what happened, from surviving family members, ethnic Albanian 
separatist forces and official Serbian information, a story emerges 
of fierce guerrilla resistance to an onslaught by Serbian tanks, artillery 
and infantry. The Serbian forces fighting here appear to have suffered 
unusually heavy losses and, after the guerrillas finally fled, took 
revenge against the civilians, shooting women and children at close 
range as they tried to run away from their pursuers. According to 
relatives who found the bodies, Pajazit Delijaj, 65, was decapitated, 
his brain left on display on the ground. Hava Delijaj, 65, was shot 
and one of her feet cut with a knife so that it hung by a thread of 
skin. Young women and children who had run a few hundred yards up 
a rocky path were mowed down. Miraculously, a 6-week-old baby, Diturie, 
was found by her father alive in the clasp of her dead mother, Lumnije, 
30, more than 24 hours after the killings. ``Blood was in her mouth 
and her mother's hand on the baby,'' said Imer Delijaj, the father, 
an avowed member of the Kosovo Liberation Army, the ethnic Albanian 
guerrilla force, who returned in uniform to discover the bodies. ``I 
moved her hand and at that moment she opened her eyes. I realized 
she was alive. I tried to clean the blood from her mouth and she put 
her tongue out.'' Several members of the Delijaj clan survived. Zejnije 
Delijaj, 39, who had cooked for the guerrillas at the family compound 
when they returned from fighting in the days before the massacre, 
recalled how she fled, crawling, falling, running and hiding in the 
woods as the Serbs shot at her. ``I could feel the dirt hitting me 
from the impact of the bullets,'' she said in an interview, her nose 
still bloodied from what she said was a heavy fall during her flight. 
``First it was machine guns, then grenades, then cannon,'' she said. 
``Every time I moved and they heard leaves rustling, they shot.'' 
The massacre of the Delijajs, whose forebears settled in the Drenica 
Valley about 150 years ago, was not the first in the conflict that 
ravaged the Serbian province between March and October and has now 
lulled into an uneasy truce. Indeed, the conflict between Serbian 
forces bent on keeping Kosovo in Serbia and guerrillas fighting for 
the independence of its heavily ethnic Albanian population first drew 
international attention with the massacre of the Jasari clan in early 
March by Serbian units at Prekaz, in central Kosovo. But the killing 
of the Delijajs, ranging from the paralyzed patriarch, Fazli, 94, 
who was burned in his bed, to the slaughter of Valmir, 18 months, 
who was found shot, is the most thoroughly documented so far. Human 
Rights Watch, a New York-based group, believes the knowledge gathered 
so far increases the possibility of prosecutions by the U.N. war crimes 
tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands. The Hague's prosecutors could 
also draw on the observations of diplomats, human rights monitors 
and reporters who saw the bodies scattered in the ravine where the 
victims were killed before they were buried in shallow graves in the 
clan's nearby compound. In other Kosovo massacres, bodies had been 
moved from the sites before they were seen by independent observers. 
Further, family members who survived the assault have described what 
they saw and the circumstances in the hills and valleys around Obrinje 
as the Serbs pushed forward early Saturday morning, Sept. 26, from 
their headquarters at Likovac, north of here. By then, the Albanian 
guerrillas had fled the area around the Delijaj compound, dispersing 
after what a senior commander of the Kosovo Liberation Army, Naim 
Maloku, termed particularly fierce combat with the Serbs. In the days 
before Sept. 26, he said, the guerrillas _ caught in a Serbian pincer 
movement _ had decided to fight rather than surrender. The fighting 
_ sometimes house to house, even room to room _ took an unusually 
heavy toll among the Serbs, said Maloku, a former officer in the Yugoslav 
army. He said he believed that it was those deaths the Serbs avenged 
with the massacre of the Delijajs. In other major attacks during the 
conflict, the guerrillas generally found an escape hatch. In Obrinje, 
led by another former officer of the Yugoslav army whom Maloku declined 
to name, the guerrillas fought, using land mines and rocket-propelled 
grenades. Maloku said he knew from a report made by rebel headquarters 
that at least 47 Serbian soldiers and police officers were killed 
in the fighting between here and Bajince, three miles east. ``We took 
weapons from 47 Serbs,'' he said. The state-controlled Serbian media 
center in Kosovo's capital, Pristina, said 10 Serbian police officers 
were killed in the fighting, including five reservists who died when 
their vehicle hit an antitank mine on Sept. 25. The announcement of 
10 Serbs killed in one action is unusually high. The practice of taking 
violent revenge is a time-honored tradition in the Balkans. From 1991 
to 1995, in the wars in Croatia and Bosnia, Serbs, Croats and, to 
a far lesser extent, the main victims, the Muslims, avenged World 
War II massacres and new blood feuds, driven into killing by leaders 
who exploited old conflicts to carve new fiefs for themselves as the 
old, Communist Yugoslavia collapsed. In this case, it appears, Serbian 
vengeance was visited upon the Delijajs. Survivors of the clan said 
they had feared an assault on their collection of mud and brick homes 
lining a rocky dirt track directly opposite the village of Likovac, 
the Serbs' base just a mile away. The Serbs had pushed the rebels 
out of Likovac in August and the guerrillas had established new headquarters 
around Bajince, six miles east of Obrinje. As the Serbs swept down 
from the nearby Cicavica Mountains, and up from the road that runs 
from Pristina to Klina, it was clear that Obrinje would be a target. 
Most women and children in the area had moved into Apple Valley, where 
more than 10,000 refugees had gathered outdoors, seeking safety in 
numbers. But Imer Delijaj, 38, said he decided that the ravine below 
his family compound would be a better hiding place. He said he believed 
the women, children and elderly would be spared if the Serbs found 
them. As the Serbs approached on foot the Saturday morning of the 
massacre, the last person to flee the compound itself was Bashkim 
Delijaj, 21, the youngest son of 94-year-old Fazli. Bashkim Delijaj 
said he had stayed behind to look after his bedridden father. ``The 
shelling started again at 7 a.m. on Saturday and I saw a tank convoy 
approaching, with infantry behind the tanks,'' Bashkim Delijaj recalled 
in an interview. ``I was smoking a cigarette when a grenade fell on 
the roof and from a hole in the gate I saw soldiers coming from about 
30 meters away. They were in brown army uniforms, had huge knives 
or small axes. Many had beards.'' Bashkim Delijaj said he was unable 
to carry his father to safety, and did not have the courage to tell 
him what was happening. ``I told him I was getting the animals out 
of the barn,'' he said. He said he ran, hid, ran some more, and eventually 
received shelter from a farmer, all the time hearing shooting and 
shelling. When the firing had died down Monday morning, he returned 
to the compound and ran into Imer, still wearing his guerrilla uniform. 
They went to one of the houses and found Imer Delijaj's brother, Adem, 
33, shot dead, his body sprawled on the ground in the rain, and the 
burned torso of Fazli. ``I looked in the window of our house and saw 
only the bones of my father, which looked like what we learned in 
biology class,'' he said. Together, the two men went to find out what 
had happened in the ravine. There they found the bodies. First, Ali, 
65, who, Imer Delijaj said, had been cut through the neck with his 
own tobacco cutting knife. Then Pajazit, who had been decapitated 
in a makeshift tent, his brain placed between two foam mattresses. 
Then Hava, 65, who was sprawled near the tent. They moved on to find 
Jeton, Imer's 10-year-old son, and Imer's mother, Hamide, 60, not 
far away. Imer's sister-in-law, Luljeta, who was seven months pregnant, 
had been mutilated, he said. A little further up the ravine, Imer 
said he saw his wife, Lumnije, 30. He opened his wife's coat and found 
his 6-week-old baby girl, now 3 months old and recovering at a relative's 
home in Likovac. He said he tried to clean the baby and then put her 
under his jacket and walked a few feet further to find the bodies 
of his 4-year-old daughter, Menduhije, and two other young children, 
Donieta, 5, and Gentiana, 7. The corpses of other family members were 
found in the woods and two older men, Habib, 51, and Hysen, 53, were 
found the next morning, Imer said. On Oct. 3, the bodies of two missing 
teen-age girls, Mehane, 16, and Antigua, 13, were found in the bushes 
at the side of a road near an abandoned Serbian police compound. Later 
in the month, the body of Hajriz was found pushed down a well, close 
to the ravine. One uncle, Sharif, who was in the ravine, is still 
missing, presumed dead. Human Rights Watch, which has been documenting 
the Delijaj massacre, has described it as the most vicious of a pattern 
of attacks on civilians by the Serbs in the Kosovo conflict. (To a 
lesser extent, Albanian guerrillas also attacked Serbian civilians, 
forcing them from their homes, and allegedly carried out at least 
two massacres.) The evidence strongly indicates that the Gornje Obrinje 
killings were followed by conscious mutilations carried out after 
the victims were killed, a coming report by Human Rights Watch says. 
Delijaj family members have told Human Rights Watch monitors and others 
that they saw an ethnic Albanian police officer accompanying the Serbian 
police officers during the fighting. They believe that the police 
officer, who is posted at the nearby Glogovac police station, was 
used by the Serbian special police officers as a guide to the Obrinje 
area. This police officer, who is apparently one of a small group 
of ethnic Albanians officers who have remained loyal to the Serbs, 
could be an important witness for criminal investigators from the 
war-crimes tribunal in The Hague, according to human rights experts. 
``The ethnic Albanian policeman could be an important witness to identifying 
the police and army units responsible for the atrocities,'' said Peter 
Boueckhart, a researcher for Human Rights Watch. ``It is vital that 
those who carried out these atrocities are prosecuted by the Hague 
tribunal.'' At the burned Delijaj compound in the last week, Imer 
Delijaj has been acting as the host of a wake which, following Albanian 
tradition, will last several weeks and began after family members 
returned from their hiding places in the woods. Color photographs 
of the youngest members of the family, and of Imer's mother and grandmother, 
have been mounted behind glass on a table outside the gate. A 30-year-old 
faded black and white picture of Fazli in a double-breasted suit stands 
apart, a sign of ultimate respect. An outsized Albanian flag with 
a black double-headed eagle on a red field is draped behind the table. 
Imer Delijaj's face seemed tense and his words were spare as he described 
his family's death. He did not express direct remorse for allowing 
his family to use a hiding place so close to the family compound, 
which for all practical purposes was an informal base for fighters. 
His lawyer, Bajram Krasniqi, who said he was eager to be helpful to 
investigators of the Hague tribunal, said in Pristina that he believed 
Imer Delijaj felt guilty for a faulty decision. Whether the tribunal 
will closely examine the case remains unclear. Slobodan Milosevic, 
the Yugoslav president, has issued only a handful of visas to investigators 
from the tribunal. Two investigators who were in Kosovo at the time 
of the massacre left six days later without visiting the site or contacting 
Krasniqi about the killings. Would Imer Delijaj seek revenge? As he 
sat on the floor of his living room with a group of male visitors, 
he replied: ``It's easy to answer. If I can see eye to eye with men 
I will fight them. But only with men in uniform and in a fair fight. 
If I see children with them, I will treat them like children all over 
the world. Children are children.''

American and allied forces in Bosnia on Wednesday arrested a Bosnian 
Serb general who was charged with genocide by the international war 
crimes tribunal in a recent secret indictment. Maj. Gen. Radislav 
Krstic, arrested without incident in the American sector in northeast 
Bosnia, is the highest-ranking official to be seized so far, and the 
first serving military officer. He is accused of directing the attack 
on Srebrenica in 1995, one of the most chilling and influential events 
of the Bosnian war, when some 7,000 Bosnian Muslim men were marched 
off, presumably to their deaths, as U.N. peacekeepers stood by. The 
indictment of Krstic accuses him of having committed genocide during 
and after the fall of Srebrenica between July 11 and Nov. 1, 1995. 
He is indicted both in connection with ``direct personal involvement 
in the commission of these crimes'' as well as his command responsibility. 
He is also accused of murder and other crimes against humanity. Krstic 
was a colonel in 1995, and the deputy commander of the Drina battalion, 
but was promoted to general within days of the fall of Srebrenica. 
He is considered a close associate of the Bosnian Serb commander, 
Gen. Ratko Mladic, and the former Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic, 
both of whom are wanted by the tribunal. And he is considered capable, 
if he is willing to testify, of implicating Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic, who has not been indicted. Louise Arbour, chief prosecutor 
of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, 
called Krstic ``a very significant military leader'' and said she 
was delighted with the arrest. The general was only indicted on Oct. 
30, tribunal officials said, but the indictment was kept secret so 
there would be a better chance of a successful arrest. NATO Secretary-General 
Javier Solana warned that other war crimes suspects still at large 
``should realize that they, too, will be brought to justice.'' James 
Rubin, the State Department spokesman, said that the arrest ``serves 
as a standing warning to those indicted for war crimes, who remain 
at large, that they will be held individually accountable for their 
actions.'' The Bosnian Serbs reacted angrily to the arrest, with the 
hardline Bosnian Serb president, Nikola Poplasen, saying that his 
government would now reduce contacts with NATO-led peacekeeping forces 
``to the necessary minimum.'' Poplasen, who defeated a more moderate 
candidate backed by Washington in September elections, said the arrest 
of Krstic had ``embittered and upset'' the Bosnian Serbs and would 
harm the implementation of the Dayton agreement that ended the 1992-1995 
Bosnian war. He said he would protest the arrest, and his remarks 
were later endorsed by parliament in a majority vote. A senior official 
of a NATO country called the arrest ``very good news'' and said it 
was ``a warning to Milosevic himself'' and others who have not been 
publicly indicted that ``the murders committed have not been forgotten.'' 
A Pentagon official said the arrest, the most important made in the 
American sector, ``was a sign that this is a continuing process.'' 
NATO-led peacekeeping troops have now arrested nine people wanted 
for war crimes in the former Yugoslavia, four of whom were the subject 
of sealed indictments. There have been numerous calls for the arrest 
of Mladic and Karadzic, the two most infamous men indicted, but they 
normally are accompanied by armed guards. NATO forces have never tried 
to arrest them, apparently fearing casualties and an angry public 
reaction from Bosnian Serbs. Officials say that both Mladic and Karadzic 
are believed to have left the Bosnian Serb Republic to live in Serbia, 
which is part of Yugoslavia and controlled by Milosvevic. Krstic, 
who was transferred to The Hague for trial, is the 35th suspect who 
has been taken there and the 26th person currently being held there. 
He is the commander of the Bosnian Serb 5th Corps and was arrested 
while traveling on the road to Bijelina. At the outset of the war 
in 1992, he was an officer of the Yugoslav Army, and like all senior 
Bosnian Serb officers, was transferred to the new Bosnian Serb force. 
In 1994, he lost a leg in a mine explosion. One Bosnian Serb official 
said in a telephone interview that, at the time, Krstic had responsibility 
for ``anti-terrorist units'' who were given some of the most difficult 
tasks. ``Srebrenica is a dark part of our history and people don't 
talk about it,'' the official said. ``But everyone believes it was 
the anti-terrorist units that were sent to do the killing.'' In Banja 
Luka on Wednesday, some members of the Bosnian Serb parliament protested 
the arrest, saying that Krstic was simply doing his job as a soldier. 
Ivo Daalder, a former Bosnia expert on the National Security Council, 
now with the Brookings Institution, said the arrest showed a new and 
promising coordination between the Tribunal and NATO troops, given 
the rapid arrest after the Oct. 30 indictment. He also said that the 
arrest of a serving officer for an important war crime would send 
an important message. Srebrenica was a key town in the Bosnian conflict. 
It was where the United Nations first made a stand in March 1993, 
when the commander of U.N. troops personally led a convoy of trucks 
to the surrounded town and promised the Bosnian Muslims there that 
Srebrenica would be a ``safe area'' and the United Nations would protect 
them. But in July 1995, the United Nations did not protect Srebrenica 
with air strikes, and peacekeeping troops watched as the Serbs marched 
in, separated Muslim men and women and marched the men off. ``Srebrenica 
signaled the massive failure of the West,'' said Daalder. ``It galvanized 
the United States and NATO to act.'' At a London conference later 
in July, NATO agreed to defend Gorazde and remaining safe areas with 
massive air strikes if necessary. After a mortar attack on the Sarajevo 
marketplace in late August, NATO air strikes began, signaling the 
last chapter of the war and leading to the American-brokered Dayton 
Accords. In Sarajevo Wednesday, an aide to the Bosnian Muslim member 
of the collective presidency, Alija Izetbegovic, praised the arrest. 
``We welcome this action, hoping very soon that the time will come 
for Karadzic and Mladic to be brought to justice,'' said the aide, 
Mirza Jajric. The arrest took place as foreign ministers of the member 
countries of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe 
met in Oslo, Norway, to discuss the international effort to keep the 
peace in Kosovo, the southern Serbian province. Under a deal pressed 
on Milosevic in October, the organization will provide up to 2,000 
civilians to monitor a cease-fire in Kosovo and to promote a political 
settlement there to give Kosovo enhanced autonomy. Macedonia's government 
Wednesday formally approved the basing of 1,700 NATO troops near its 
border with Kosovo. Those troops will be prepared to rush to the aid 
of the civilian monitors if necessary.
