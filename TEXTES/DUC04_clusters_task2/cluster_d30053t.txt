Less than a week before U.S. President Bill Clinton is to arrive for 
a visit meant to bolster a new Israeli-Palestinian peace accord, the 
two sides exchanged angry accusations Sunday over Jewish settlements 
and street clashes. Ahmed Qureia, speaker of the Palestinian parliament, 
warned of possible violence if Israel continues to expand settlements 
in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, where the Palestinians hope to establish 
a state. ``If settlement activity continues, then all means of resistance 
are open,'' Qureia, who is also known as Abu Ala, told reporters in 
the West Bank town of Ramallah. Since the signing of a land-for-security 
accord, Jewish settlers have accelerated the establishment of makeshift 
communities on West Bank hilltops, in an explicit bid to keep the 
land from being turned over to the Palestinians. Meanwhile, at a meeting 
of the Israeli Cabinet, ministers expressed dismay over an outbreak 
of street clashes between Palestinian demonstrators and Israeli troops 
in the West Bank. ``The Palestinians have been asked to immediately 
stop the violence and incitement to violence,'' the Cabinet said in 
a statement. At least two Palestinians were injured Sunday in a confrontation 
outside the Jewish settlement of Ariel in the northern West Bank. 
Demonstrators threw stones at Israeli troops, who responded with rubber 
bullets and tear gas. A day earlier, 27 Palestinians and three Israeli 
soldiers were injured in similar clashes throughout the West Bank. 
And three days before that, Israelis were horrified by television 
footage of an Israeli soldier being dragged from a car and beaten 
with chunks of concrete by a Palestinian mob. Israel says Yasser Arafat's 
Palestinian Authority is orchestrating the street fighting. The Palestinians 
deny that. The past week's protests grew out of an increasingly bitter 
dispute over Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. Israel last month 
freed 250 of 750 prisoners it is to release under the Wye accords, 
but most were criminals. The Palestinians are demanding that so-called 
security prisoners _ those being held for anti-Israel activity _ be 
released instead. Also Sunday, another quarrel was brewing over the 
scheduled meeting of the Palestinian National Council, the Palestinian 
parliament-in-exile, in the Gaza Strip during Clinton's visit. At 
the gathering, the PNC and other Palestinians in attendance are to 
reaffirm the nullification of clauses in their national charter that 
call for Israel's destruction. Israel has demanded that the Palestinians 
hold an actual vote at the meeting rather than simply proclaiming 
the charter changed, but the Palestinians on Sunday repeated their 
objections to that. ``They haven't the right to give us instructions,'' 
Arafat said Sunday as he returned to Gaza following a trip to Europe. 
Clinton's visit to Israel and the Palestinian lands, which is to begin 
Saturday, is meant to provide impetus to the U.S.-brokered peace accords 
and encourage both sides to stick to a timetable for compliance. But 
some commentators suggested the visit was proving a polarizing force 
instead. ``He is coming to promote the peace process... but his visit's 
only actual result is a sharpening of the differences,'' Yosef Lapid 
wrote in Sunday's editions of the Maariv newspaper. In Israel, increasing 
concern is being voiced over Clinton's planned visit to Gaza, the 
first ever by a sitting U.S. president. At Sunday's Israeli Cabinet 
meeting, a shouting match broke out over the issue, according to Israel 
radio. ``Who invited President Clinton to the Gaza Strip?'' Silvan 
Shalom, the science minister, reportedly yelled at Netanyahu. Netanyahu 
said it had been Clinton's idea, not his. The United States has repeatedly 
said the visit is not intended as an endorsement of Palestinian statehood, 
but the Palestinians see it as a powerful boost to their sovereignty 
hopes. Arafat adviser Ahmed Tibi said on Israeli television that the 
invitation for a Clinton visit came from Israel and was ``warmly welcomed'' 
by the Palestinians.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday accused Yasser Arafat 
of ``making a farce'' of the Wye River accords and said he would not 
agree to further troop withdrawals until a halt to anti-Israel violence. 
Netanyahu, in an interview with The Associated Press, said the Palestinians 
were emboldened to foment street riots and threaten to declare statehood 
because they believed they had the Clinton administration ``in their 
back pocket.'' ``The Palestinians are making a farce out of the Wye 
River accord. They think they have the United States in their back 
pocket,'' said the Israeli leader. ``As long as that is the case, 
they will not change their behavior.'' Netanyahu said he did not believe 
the United States was siding with the Palestinians, but his sharply 
worded remarks sent a strong signal that he would like President Bill 
Clinton to intervene and lower Palestinian expectations prior to his 
Dec. 12-15 trip. Palestinians claim it is Israel that has violated 
the summit agreement reached in October by not freeing jailed political 
activists, by confiscating West Bank land for roads and allowing Jewish 
settlers to seize hilltops for expansion. Ahmed Qureia, speaker of 
the Palestinian Legislative Council and the head of the peace team 
that negotiated the Oslo accords, told reporters Sunday ``all means 
of resistance'' was justified in opposing settler activity. Netanyahu, 
who rejected claims of settlement expansion as ``bunk,'' was interviewed 
in the Cabinet room after a meeting of his unruly coalition government, 
which rallied behind Netanyahu on his tough stance. But officials 
said Science Minister Silvan Shalom attacked him for being too generous 
to the Palestinians by agreeing to the Clinton visit next week to 
Gaza and the West Bank. ``We are not going to give up territory when 
there are violations of the agreement and attempts to get things that 
weren't achieved at Wye using violence,'' Netanyahu said. Israel has 
threatened to scrap the next Israeli troop pullback, which is scheduled 
for Dec. 18, three days after Clinton's departure. The United States 
has said it should go ahead as scheduled. Palestinians see the Clinton 
trip as implicit recognition of their struggle for statehood, even 
though Clinton has specifically said in an interview aired on Israel's 
Channel 2 television that it should not be read that way. Netanyahu 
made clear that he would be annoyed if Air Force One landed at the 
newly opened Palestinian airport in Gaza, which aides said would be 
viewed as a strong symbol of support for Palestinian demands for sovereignty. 
``We will be very disappointed if that is the case. We've said to 
the United States that we don't think that is necessary,'' Netanyahu 
said of reports that Clinton's plane would land in Gaza. He said traveling 
by motorcade would be quicker and more politically considerate. ``Unless 
somebody wants to put a thumb in our eye, I think there are better 
ways to travel,'' Netanyahu said. In the interview, Netanyahu stressed 
that he opposed Palestinian statehood and demanded that Arafat stop 
threatening to declare independence on May 4, 1999, when the Palestinians 
maintain the Oslo accords expire. ``What must be is that Yasser Arafat 
retracts this open and incipient violation of the Oslo and Wye River 
accords and recommits himself to negotiating until we get white smoke, 
until we get a solution. That's the only way we'll get a real peace 
between Israel and the Palestinians,'' Netanyahu said. In a conciliatory 
speech in Sweden over the weekend, Arafat stressed that he sought 
a negotiated settlement and did not mention May 4 as a deadline. He 
also said any Palestinian state would not make alliances with states 
hostile to Israel _ one of Netanyahu's key concerns. The Israeli leader 
is also demanding that Arafat drop claims that Netanyahu promised 
at Wye to release 750 Palestinians jailed for anti-Israel attacks 
that resulted in bloodshed, rather than freeing car thieves and petty 
criminals. Each side has a different interpretation of the understanding 
regarding the prisoners. Netanyahu maintains he never agreed to free 
those with ``blood on their hands.'' ``It's high time that Yasser 
Arafat admits this was agreed upon and that he's not going to make 
demands on Israel, including the incitement of violence,...on a trumped-up 
charge, '' he said. ``Israel never promised to release murders at 
Wye, and it won't release them.'' The issue has been the focal point 
for a new wave of violent protests and demonstrations in the West 
Bank and a hunger strike that began Saturday by the 1,700 Palestinian 
inmates. Israel is also upset by statements that the nearly 600-member 
Palestinian National Council will not reaffirm in a vote that anti-Israel 
clauses in the Palestinian charter have been deleted. Netanyahu maintained 
that only 25 members out of hundreds who live abroad had been invited 
so far. Netanyahu quoted Clinton as telling him that the purpose of 
his visit was to ``personally make sure that they actually rescind 
this charter that calls for Israel's destruction.''

Armored personnel carriers were deployed Tuesday around the convention 
center where U.S. President Bill Clinton will address 1,500 Palestinian 
delegates next week. U.S. Secret Service agents have already arrived 
in Gaza to work with their Palestinian counterparts on how to protect 
Clinton during his first visit to Palestinian areas. ``There is cooperation 
with the American security people. We have our own plan. The Americans 
have their own procedures as well,'' said the Palestinian police chief, 
Ghazi Jabali. The Islamic militant group Hamas, which hopes to scuttle 
the accord, has been careful not to openly threaten Clinton. However, 
Hamas has carried out more than a dozen suicide bombings in Israel 
in an attempt to bring peace talks with Israel to a halt. On Monday, 
Clinton and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat are to address members 
of the Palestine National Council and delegates from other groups, 
at the Shawa Cultural Center in Gaza City. Traffic near the Shawa 
Center still flowed normally Tuesday, but plainclothes security as 
well as uniformed officers with M-17 and AK-47 assault rifles began 
patrolling in the vicinity. Streets around the center are to be closed 
days before the Clinton visit. Four armored personnel were parked 
at the corners of the convention center, with members of Arafat's 
elite bodyguard unit, known as Force 17, sitting on the vehicles. 
APCs were also deployed outside Arafat's guest house and near the 
Palestinian legislative council. Jabali said the APCs were part of 
a Palestinian security plan that has been presented to the Americans. 
U.S. security agents, in turn, have given their Palestinian counterparts 
sophisticated explosives detection equipment. ``The Palestinian police 
are ready to protect President Clinton here in Gaza or in Bethlehem,'' 
Jabali said, referring to Clinton's expected visit next Tuesday to 
the Church of the Nativity in the biblical West Bank town of Bethlehem 
In Jerusalem, Clinton's entourage of 1,200 people will take over the 
Jerusalem Hilton, at a cost of half a million dollars. The hotel boasts 
stunning views of Jerusalem's walled Old City and the slopes of the 
Judean Desert. 
 APW19981210.0305 
Keeping a promise to Israel and the United States, Palestinian leader 
Yasser Arafat on Thursday convened senior officials and legislators 
to revoke clauses of the PLO founding charter calling for Israel's 
destruction. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, meanwhile, 
said he has ordered the Israeli army to deal with Palestinian riots 
with a ``firm hand.'' He added that he would not go ahead with a West 
Bank troop pullback, as promised under the Wye River peace agreement, 
unless Arafat met a list of demands. The West Bank has been swept 
by stone-throwing protests in recent days, and thousands of Palestinians 
marched Thursday in the funeral procession of a 17-year-old stone 
mason, Jihad Iyad, who was killed by Israeli army gunfire a day earlier. 
The violence raised concern that U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit 
to the region, which is to start late Saturday, is fomenting more 
unrest rather than calming the already tense situation. Israeli hard-liners, 
including Cabinet ministers, have said Clinton's visit is conferring 
statehood status on the Palestinian areas. On Thursday, signs reading 
``Clinton go home'' were strung along the Tel Aviv-Jerusalem highway 
and on walls in Jerusalem. The most problematic moment of the Clinton 
visit will be his address Monday to the Palestine National Council, 
the Palestinians' parliament-in-exile, and other Palestinian groups, 
in Gaza City. Under the Wye agreement, the PNC is to reaffirm during 
this session an Arafat letter to Clinton which declares clauses of 
the PLO founding charter calling for Israel's destruction revoked. 
Israel insists a vote be taken by a show of hands, while the Palestinians 
say only approval by acclamation is required. Netanyahu said Thursday 
he will not settle for anything less than a vote, even if Clinton 
declares the PNC session a success without it. ``It is Israel which 
determines issues connected with its future,'' Netanyahu said when 
asked by Israel radio whether he would be ready to enter a showdown 
with Clinton over the issue. It is unlikely the U.S. president would 
side with Israel in such a dispute because it would mean that the 
main purpose of his visit, to usher in the next stage of the Wye agreement, 
had failed. Immediately after the PNC session, Israel is to transfer 
five percent of the West Bank from its sole control to joint jurisdiction. 
Netanyahu said last week he was freezing the pullback over what he 
claimed were systematic Palestinian violations of the peace accord. 
He reiterated Thursday that he would not change his decision unless 
Arafat publicly dropped plans to unilaterally declare a Palestinian 
state in May. The prime minister's critics have said he is seizing 
excuse after excuse to walk away from the agreement because he faces 
a very real threat from hard-liners in his coalition to bring down 
the government in the event of another troop withdrawal. The Palestinians, 
meanwhile, pressed ahead with implementing the accord. On Thursday, 
98 members of the 124-member Palestinian Central Council met at Arafat's 
seaside headquarters to hold a vote on whether to approve the Arafat 
letter concerning the PLO charter. The meeting is an interim step, 
ahead of Monday's PNC session, and is stipulated by the Wye agreement. 
A simple majority of 63 members is required, and a vote was expected 
by Thursday evening. The council has not met for years and was revived 
specifically for Thursday's vote. It consists of PNC delegates, members 
of the Palestinian legislative council and the PLO Executive Committee, 
among others. 
 APW19981211.0628 
Israel affirmed Friday that it will not withdraw troops in the West 
Bank unless the top Palestinian decision-making body holds a vote 
to annul clauses of the PLO charter calling for Israel's destruction. 
Just a day before U.S. President Bill Clinton's arrival, Israel also 
rejected a U.S. compromise on the release of Palestinian prisoners, 
an issue that has sparked riots in the West Bank. The Palestinians 
have said they would revoke the clauses only by acclamation, not by 
a vote, when the Palestine National Council meets on Monday in Clinton's 
presence. With its demand, Israel may be setting itself up for a showdown 
with Clinton whose visit to Israel and the Palestinian is ushering 
in the next stage of the Wye River land-for-security agreement he 
helped negotiate. Under the accord, the annulment of the offending 
provisions by the PNC is to clear the way for an Israeli troop pullback. 
Clinton is unlikely to declare the PNC has not completed its task 
because that would mean his high-profile visit has been a failure. 
However, Israeli officials said they would not drop their demand for 
a vote. ``They have to vote in the PNC,'' said Israeli government 
spokesman Moshe Fogel. Otherwise, he said, Israel will not turn over 
additional West Bank territory to the Palestinians because ``transfer 
of territory is irreversible.'' In Washington, deputy U.S. State Department 
spokesman James Foley was evasive on whether the United States expected 
a vote from the PNC. ``The procedures need to be clear enough that 
nullification has taken place,'' he said. A senior Palestinian official, 
speaking on condition of anonymity, said the United States has not 
asked Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to consider holding a vote. 
On Thursday, the Palestinians took an interim step when a smaller 
leadership body, the 124-member Palestinian Central Council, declared 
the charter clauses revoked. The 95 members present were asked whether 
they approved a letter in which Arafat informed Clinton that the charter 
clauses calling for Israel's destruction were null and void. In all, 
81 voted in favor, seven against and seven abstained. Asked about 
the decision, Arafat would only say that ``it was a very important 
and constructive meeting.'' The Palestinian leader also said he hoped 
Clinton would exert pressure on Israel to keep its obligations under 
the Wye agreement. The Palestine Liberation Organization charter was 
drawn up three decades ago, long before Israel and the Palestinians 
started their peace process in 1993. The Palestinians say they took 
all the required steps to revoke the pertinent clauses at a PNC session 
in Gaza in 1996. However, Netanyahu has said the PNC never completed 
the job. During the Wye River talks, the Palestinians agreed in a 
compromise to invite PNC members and delegates from other groups to 
Gaza to hear Clinton and Arafat speak. The Wye accord says delegates 
should ``reaffirm'' the Arafat letter to Clinton, but does not specifically 
refer to a vote. Former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres sided 
with the Palestinians on Friday. ``They did it once, they did it twice, 
they don't have to do it again,'' said Peres, who was prime minister 
during the PNC vote in 1996. Israel and the Palestinians have also 
accused each other of violating other elements of the Wye agreement. 
A key point of contention has been Israel's pledge to release 750 
Palestinian prisoners in three stages by the end of January. The Palestinians 
have said Israel broke a promise to release prisoners held for anti-Israeli 
activities. Israel said it never made such a pledge, and accused the 
Palestinian Authority of incitement over the prisoner issue. Palestinian 
negotiator Saeb Erekat said the United States offered a compromise, 
a trilateral committee to go over the list of prisoners one by one 
and determine who will be released. But Israeli Cabinet Secretary 
Danny Naveh said Friday such a proposal was unacceptable. ``Israel 
has not been offered such a compromise and there will not be such 
a compromise,'' Naveh said. On Friday, about 2,000 supporters of the 
Islamic militant Hamas movement marched through the West Bank town 
of Nablus to press for the release or prisoners. ``We want prisoners, 
not Clinton,'' the crowd chanted. At Jerusalem's Al Aqsa Mosque, Islam's 
third holiest site, the prayer leader, Yousef Abu Sneineh, spoke out 
sharply against the U.S.-brokered peace agreement. ``America supports 
a peace agreement that further reinforces the Israeli occupation of 
the Palestinian lands,'' he said.

On a street newly littered with the debris of battle _ stones, spent 
tear gas canisters, charred remnants of half-burned tires _ a sodden 
Palestinian flag flaps in a fitful rain-laden wind outside a house 
in mourning. Inside, to the tinny recorded wail of Koranic verses, 
neighbors and relatives of the dead man _ a 21-year-old university 
student felled on the roof of his own home by an Israeli soldier's 
rubber-coated bullet _ sipped tiny cups of coffee left unsweetened 
to symbolize the bitter occasion. Some smoked, a few spoke quietly 
among themselves, but most simply sat in reflective silence. Among 
those in attendance on this day, the first of the traditional three 
days of family mourning, was Saeb Erekat, the chief peace negotiator 
for Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority. The dead youth, Nasr Erekat, 
was a cousin of his. Erekat stayed for a time, sitting amid clan elders 
in Arab headdresses and teen-age nephews in American-style athletic 
shoes, then slipped away for a meeting in connection with President 
Clinton's visit beginning this weekend. ``It's been very difficult,'' 
he said later, asked about carrying on his negotiating duties at such 
a time. ``I have a great sense of sorrow and sadness, a feeling of 
such loss. I hope God will enable me to use my grief to strengthen 
my determination for peace.'' The scene at the Erekat home, in the 
Arab village of Abu Dis on Jerusalem's eastern outskirts, drives home 
a central truth about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict: on both sides 
of the divide, the political is also deeply personal. And that inescapability 
goes to the heart of the quarrel's intractability. In the glare of 
world attention, it is easy to forget that there are fewer people 
living in Israel and the Palestinian lands combined than there are 
in New York City. In the small and jostling confines of what few here 
choose to call the Holy Land, the conflict touches all. Everyone has 
a stake in it. Israelis fret daily over soldier sons on dangerous 
patrol in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, or shudder when they pass 
a sidewalk cafe once ripped by an Islamic militant's suicide bomb. 
Palestinian families struggle to keep alive the memories of fathers 
and brothers languishing in Israeli prisons, and chafe under the checkpoints 
and gunsights of Israeli troops. On both sides, the youngest soak 
up fear and anger along with their ABCs. And elders' memories of half 
a century past still rise to trouble the collective sleep: the shadow 
of the Holocaust for Israelis, the trauma of exile and dispossession 
for the Palestinians. Against this backdrop, amid a landscape little 
changed since biblical times, terrible Old Testament themes _ lamentation 
and retribution, the smiting of enemies and the sharpening of swords 
_ spring to life once again in any day's headlines. Now comes Clinton, 
this most American of presidents, one who has made Middle East peacemaking 
a kind of personal crusade, in hopes of halting what has become one 
of the century's most protracted blood feuds. Clinton is no stranger 
to these particular hatreds. Three years ago, in another winter season, 
he came here to bury Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, gunned down by 
a nationalist Jew who could not abide the terms of a Mideast agreement 
that called _ just as this latest accord does _ for Israel to cede 
West Bank land in exchange for peace with the Palestinians. On the 
occasion of this visit _ first intended to celebrate the Wye River 
accords signed seven weeks ago in Washington, now meant to salvage 
them _ all three of the principals are embattled. Clinton is under 
an impeachment cloud; Arafat is buffeted by furious Palestinian street 
protests and his own failing health, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's 
coalition government is hanging by a thread. The days leading up to 
Clinton's visit have been divisive ones, contriving somehow to simultaneously 
tap into both sides' greatest fears. In the West Bank's worst spasm 
of violence in months, Israelis watched windows of Israeli-plated 
cars shatter from stones thrown by angry youths, saw TV footage of 
a cringing Israeli soldier _ now facing court martial _ being beaten 
bloody by a Palestinian mob, heard Palestinian officials' exhortations 
for a new intefadeh, or uprising. Palestinians, for their part, listened 
in anger as Netanyahu announced the suspension of an upcoming Israeli 
troop pullback in the West Bank and tried vainly to halt Israeli bulldozers 
expanding Jewish settlements on land they claim as their own. Both 
sides _ to Palestinians' satisfaction, and Israel's dismay _ came 
to see the visit as an implicit acknowledgement of Palestinian statehood 
aspirations, despite increasingly desperate American efforts to avoid 
casting it in that light. Clinton's foray to the Gaza Strip, which 
is already under Palestinian rule, will be the first by a sitting 
American president. Palestinians intend to play on that symbolism 
for all it is worth, greeting him with the strains of their once-banned 
national anthem. In the mourning house in Abu Dis, though, the friends 
and relatives of Nasr Erekat had little to say about politics and 
statehood. They talked about Nasr instead. Amr Erekat, 27, recalled 
his disbelief as he cradled his dying cousin in his arms. His 14-year-old 
brother Taher spoke haltingly of the big brother he had looked up 
to. His childhood friend, Samir Abdel Salam, remembered wishing he 
had stuck to his studies as diligently as Nasr had. Saeb Erekat, the 
peace negotiator, could find neither lesson nor logic to his young 
cousin's death. ``It's senseless, this rhythm of bloodshed,'' he said. 
``At these difficult times, you pray for one thing, for both sides: 
no more of it.'' 
 APW19981213.0224 
In an atmosphere of political tension, U.S. President Clinton met 
Sunday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a bid to 
put the troubled Wye River peace accord back on track. After getting 
together for breakfast in Clinton's hotel suite, the two leaders met 
at Netanyahu's office and planned to talk to reporters later. The 
president was sure to be asked about the impeachment drama unfolding 
in Washington. At a late-night arrival ceremony for Clinton Saturday, 
Netanyahu said he hoped the president's visit would ``contribute to 
true peace.'' Again, the Israeli leader accused the Palestinians of 
ignoring commitments in peace accords. Clinton is to meet with Palestinian 
leader Yasser Arafat on Monday in the Gaza Strip. Thousands of police 
were deployed throughout Israel during the Clinton visit. At the hotel 
where Clinton is staying, 500 policemen were posted to guard the president 
and his 600-member delegation. Clinton's wife, Hillary, and their 
daughter, Chelsea, set out on their own schedule. Mrs. Clinton toured 
a school in a cooperative village of Jews and Palestinians, while 
Chelsea visited Jerusalem's Western Wall, Judaism's holiest site. 
Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon told reporters during a picture-taking 
session with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright that Israel ``has 
not left'' the Wye River agreement. ``We will not give up'' on the 
land-for-security accord, Sharon said. But, he added, ``it should 
be based on mutual reciprocity.'' About two hours before Air Force 
One landed Saturday night, the House Judiciary Committee approved 
a fourth article of impeachment against Clinton. The full House will 
vote on the impeachment articles next week. Israeli government spokesman 
Moshe Fogel was asked Sunday if the success of Clinton's visit would 
turn on the question of revoking the Palestinian Liberation Organization's 
founding charter. ``President Clinton played a very important role 
in the Wye Memorandum and its success, and I think that it's going 
to be very, very important that this visit show us at least a readiness 
on the part of the Palestinian Authority to move forward in peace,'' 
Fogel said. There was no letup in violence Sunday. Palestinian stone 
throwers clashed with Israeli troops and an Israeli high school student 
was stabbed and wounded by a Palestinian teen-ager. In his remarks 
at Clinton's airport arrival Saturday night, Netanyahu said the peace 
process is in danger. ``Mr. President,'' Netanyahu said, speaking 
in Hebrew, ``The truth has to be told. In recent weeks the Palestinians 
again constantly, systematically and intentionally violated all their 
commitments. We are not entitled, not able and not prepared to forgo 
fulfillment of those commitments.'' Netanyahu, who is facing political 
turmoil in his hard-line coalition government, said he could not accept 
``a phony peace on paper'' which is ``not honored in practice.'' Since 
Clinton presided over its signing in Washington in October, the land-for-security 
agreement has hit one snag after another. Israel froze implementation 
of the accord altogether, accusing Arafat of violating the deal and 
inciting violent street protests. Clinton said the United States shares 
Israel's concerns about security. ``Peace is not simply an option 
among many but the only choice that can avert still more years of 
bloodshed, apprehension and sorrow,'' he said. ``That is why I'm here.'' 
He said ``both sides now must face the challenge of implementing Wye.'' 
Both Clinton and Netanyahu have a shaky political future. The Israeli 
leader is fighting for his political survival as parliament prepares 
for a no-confidence vote within two weeks. His coalition began to 
weaken after he and Arafat signed the Wye River Memorandum Oct. 23 
agreeing to turn over 13 percent of West Bank territory to be met 
by Palestinian security measures. Netanyahu has said there would be 
no further troop withdrawals until West Bank rioting and violence 
ends. Israel and the Palestinians are also in bitter disagreement 
over procedures for revoking passages in the Palestinian charter calling 
for Israel's destruction and the release of Palestinian prisoners 
held in Israeli jails for militant or political acts against the Jewish 
state. On Monday, the president is to fly to the Palestinian-run Gaza 
Strip to be welcomed by Arafat with the trappings of a state visit. 
Clinton's visit to Gaza and his address to the Palestinian National 
Council is seen by some as a boost for dreams of Palestinian statehood. 
``It implies de facto recognition of a Palestinian state,'' Ziyad 
Abu Ziyad, a member of the Palestinian legislative council, said in 
an interview Sunday.

Benjamin Netanyahu's refusal to move the peace process forward, which 
has frustrated President Bill Clinton and angered the Palestinians, 
may not be enough to save his government from collapse next week. 
Netanyahu on Wednesday briefed his Cabinet on Clinton's three-day 
visit and affirmed what he told the president a day earlier _ that 
he would not withdraw troops in the West Bank on Friday, as stipulated 
by the Wye River peace accord. Clinton had hoped, 3rd graf pvs

President Clinton will travel to Gaza next month to address Palestinian 
leaders, the White House said Friday. He is to speak at what the Palestinians 
are describing as a historic meeting to formally revoke anti-Israel 
clauses in the 1964 Palestinian charter. Israel demanded revocation 
of the clauses at U.S.-brokered negotiations last month that led to 
the latest land-for-peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians. 
As part of that settlement, reached at Wye, Md., Clinton agreed to 
travel to territory controlled by the Palestinian Authority to speak 
at the meeting of the Palestinian National Council, the de facto parliament. 
According to a schedule released Friday by the White House, Clinton 
will visit Gaza, the West Bank and Israel during a four-day trip that 
will begin on Dec. 12. He is to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu of Israel and Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, before 
returning to Washington on Dec. 15. Clinton administration officials 
said the White House had not yet decided whether Clinton would fly 
to the newly opened Gaza International Airport aboard Air Force One, 
given the symbolism of the president's jet landing on Palestinian 
soil with the trappings of a state visit. Officials said the White 
House was fearful of upsetting Israeli leaders who are worried that 
the president's planned visit to Gaza appears to be a step toward 
American recognition of a Palestinian state. The White House said 
the president would ``speak to the Israeli and Palestinian people 
about the importance of the Wye agreement and the need to continue 
to support the Middle East peace process.'' The meeting in Gaza on 
Dec. 14 is bound to be contentious, given that many prominent Palestinians 
have charged that the Wye agreement allows the Israeli government 
to backtrack on promises made to the Palestinians in their 1994 peace 
settlement. The Palestinians have insisted that they have already 
revoked clauses in the 1964 charter that called for Israel's destruction. 
In January, Arafat wrote to the White House, listing the anti-Israel 
provisions that he said had been annulled. But the letter did not 
satisfy the Israelis. And during the talks in Maryland last month, 
Arafat agreed to call a meeting of the national council to ``reaffirm'' 
the decision to revoke the clauses. In order to guarantee passage 
of a motion to annul the provisions, Arafat is being allowed under 
an agreement with the Israelis and the United States to pack the council 
meeting in Gaza with his loyalists, and to conduct the vote by a show 
of hands instead of a ballot. During a recent interview with Israeli 
television, Clinton brushed aside concerns that his visit to Gaza 
might be seen as a step toward U.S. recognition of a Palestinian state. 
``That is not what I'm doing in going there,'' he said. ``I have tried 
strictly to adhere to the position of the United States that we would 
not take a position on any final status issue.'' He said he was traveling 
to Gaza at the recommendation of, among others, Netanyahu. ``The prime 
minister wanted me to go there and wanted us all to make this pitch,'' 
he said, adding that he would ask the Palestinian National Council 
``to support the peace and to renounce the idea of animosity toward 
and opposition to the existence of the state of Israel, and instead 
embrace the path not only of peace but of cooperation.''
