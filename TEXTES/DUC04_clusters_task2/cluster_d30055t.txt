Italy's Communists on Sunday voted to withdraw support for Premier 
Romano Prodi's 2 1-2-year-old coalition, a move expected to trigger 
the collapse of one of the country's longest-lived postwar governments. 
Prodi had said he would call a confidence vote if the Communists yanked 
support. The coalition has a majority without the Communists in the 
Senate, but has depended on them for passage of key legislation in 
the Chamber. MORE

Premier Romano Prodi said Monday he would appeal directly to Parliament 
to save Italy's second-longest government since World War II, threatened 
with collapse by the defection of its Communist ally. The address 
to Parliament was expected Wednesday, followed perhaps by Friday by 
the vote of confidence that will determine whether Prodi's 2 1/2-year-old, 
center-left alliance stands or falls. Prodi's far-left ally, the Communist 
Refoundation Party, provoked the crisis by withdrawing its support 
over the weekend and saying it would not vote for his deficit-cutting 
1999 budget, which is key to Italy's participation in the European 
common currency. Prodi has said he would call a confidence vote if 
he lost the Communists' support. ``I've always acted with coherence,'' 
Prodi said before a morning meeting with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro 
on the crisis. ``I've never changed strategy and I don't want to do 
political gymnastics.'' The break with Prodi's government divided 
Refoundation. Armando Cossutta, leader of the moderate wing, resigned 
as party president Monday. He said the party's desertion of Prodi 
was ``wrong and dangerous,'' but at the same time promised to follow 
the party line. ``We are in a very complicated political crisis which 
could lead to early elections,'' Cossutta told reporters Monday. ``And 
with the divisions in the left, this would mean a victory for the 
right.'' If the crisis comes to a confidence vote and Prodi loses, 
he would offer his resignation. Once he does that, it is up to Scalfaro 
to decide what to do. He could ask Prodi or someone else to form a 
new government or he could call elections 2 1/2 years early, something 
most analysts think unlikely. Working in Prodi's favor is the fact 
that few parties think they would stand to gain by early elections, 
including the Communist Refoundation. There was speculation Prodi 
would reopen negotiations that would win back the communists' grudging 
support, as he has managed to do in the past. Prodi's government has 
held together this long in large part because of the widely shared 
desire to see Italy qualify for participation in the 1999 debut of 
Europe's common currency, the euro. That happened earlier this year 
_ leaving the disparate allies without so clear a reason to stay together. 
Prodi leads Italy's 55th government since World War II. He has outlasted 
all but Bettino Craxi, who served 3{ years in two back-to-back stints 
from 1983 to 1987. Refoundation is not part of Prodi's center-left 
coalition, but the government needs its 34 votes to muster a majority 
in the lower house. It has been a difficult ally from the outset. 
It broke with Prodi over NATO expansion earlier this year and on sending 
troops into Albania last year. Prodi was even forced to resign a year 
ago after a bitter battle over spending cuts linked to the euro. The 
crisis was resolved, and Prodi returned to work, after he made steep 
concessions and promised a 35-hour work week.

Premier Romano Prodi battled Tuesday for any votes freed up from a 
split in a far-left party, but said he will resign if he loses a confidence 
vote expected later this week. ``We must respect the will of the voters. 
If we win the confidence vote, we will go ahead, otherwise we will 
pass the baton,'' Prodi told a news conference closing a two-day French-Italian 
summit in Florence. Prodi's center-left government, Italy's second-longest 
since World War II, was threatened with collapse by the defection 
of its Communist ally. The premier will address Parliament Wednesday, 
followed perhaps by Friday by the vote of confidence that will determine 
whether the 2 1/2-year-old, center-left alliance stands or falls. 
The Communist Refoundation Party provoked the crisis by withdrawing 
its support over the weekend and saying it would not vote for his 
deficit-cutting 1999 budget. But the break with Prodi's government 
divided Refoundation. Armando Cossutta, leader of the moderate wing, 
resigned as party president Monday, saying the party's hardline stance 
was ``wrong and dangerous.'' Prodi was hoping to profit from the break. 
Politicians have said Prodi is now four votes short of the 316 votes 
needed for a majority in the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house. 
The government has a majority in the Senate even without Refoundation's 
support. After his meetings with French leaders, Prodi warned that 
the political difficulties threaten the progress the country is making 
in cleaning up its public finances. Prodi's government has held together 
this long in large part because of the widely shared desire to see 
Italy qualify for the 1999 debut of Europe's common currency, the 
euro. It qualified earlier this year _ leaving the disparate allies 
without so clear a reason to stay together. As it is, Prodi has outlasted 
all but Bettino Craxi, who served 3{ years in two back-to-back stints 
from 1983 to 1987. Prodi's is Italy's 55th government since World 
War II.

Three days after the collapse of Premier Romano Prodi's center-left 
government, Italy's president began calling in political leaders Monday 
to try to reach a consensus on a new government. Following the talks, 
which are expected to last several days, President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro 
could ask Prodi to try again with a new majority. He could also name 
a new premier, or appoint a government of technocrats. If Scalfaro 
feels no candidate is capable of mustering a majority, he could call 
early elections. Because the president cannot dissolve Parliament 
during the last six weeks of his term, elections would have to be 
scheduled by December. Scalfaro has named Prodi as caretaker premier 
for the interim. Prodi's far-left ally, Communist Refoundation, provoked 
the crisis when it withdrew support for the government over the 1999 
deficit-cutting budget, which it said did not do enough to stimulate 
job creation. Despite help from a breakaway faction of the Communists, 
who on Sunday formed a new party, Prodi lost Friday's vote of confidence 
by a single vote. Prodi has said he won't take the job back unless 
his new government could stick to the policies of its old one, an 
unlikely scenario given the divided Parliament. An alternative to 
Prodi could be Massimo D'Alema, leader of the Democrats of the Left, 
the largest party in Prodi's coalition. In the case of a so-called 
``technical'' government, the names of Treasury Minister Carlo Azeglio 
Ciampi and Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini have been circulated. A 
government of technicians would get Italy through the volatile period 
of approving the 1999 budget and the launch of the common European 
currency, the euro, in January 1999. Prodi presided over cost cuts 
that got Italy into the debut of the European Monetary Union, outlasting 
all but one other post-World War II Italian government in the process.

It is autumn in Italy, the birds are going south, and so it seems 
could the Italian government, as the bonds of compromise and political 
opportunism that bind a small leftist party to the government came 
undone Sunday. The latest threat to the government of Prime Minister 
Romano Prodi came after delegates to a two-day conference of the Communist 
Refounding Party voted to reject the government's proposed 1999 budget, 
imperiling the future of the center-left coalition. Officials in the 
prime minister's office said Sunday night that Prodi would meet on 
Monday with President Oskar Luigi Scalfaro to discuss the political 
turbulence, though not to offer his resignation. If the Communist 
Refounding's parliamentary deputies abide by the resolution, which 
passed by a vote of 188-112, it will destabilize Italy's government 
at a time when the outcome of the recent election in Germany has already 
injected a note of uncertainty into the future of European economic 
and fiscal policy. Mauro Zani, a spokesman for the Democratic Party 
of the Left, the main party in Prodi's coalition, called the decision 
by Communist Refounding a ``misfortune for the entire country.'' Passage 
of the budget, he said, is essential ``to avoid disaster.'' Prodi's 
coalition is a loose alliance of the former Communists, known as the 
Democratic Party of the Left, and Prodi's moderate Catholic-oriented 
followers. It is supported by Communist Refounding, a fringe group 
of hard-line leftists who broke with the mainstream Communists after 
they overhauled the party following the collapse of Communism in Eastern 
Europe. Despite frequent shocks, the alliance has held since 1996, 
glued together mainly by the desire to meet the fiscal requirements 
to allow Italy to adopt the single European currency. As the Jan. 
1 date approaches for the introduction of the new money, the euro, 
Italy must cut its key lending rates to bring them in line with those 
of bigger European neighbors, like Germany. A rate cut by the Italian 
central bank is generally thought to hinge on passage of the budget 
bill. If the bill is not passed, negative signals would be sent to 
global financial markets that are already upset because of the financial 
crises in Asia, Russia and Latin America. On Sunday, Prodi's backers 
were still hoping that a sufficient number of Communist Refounding 
deputies would break ranks and back the budget when it comes up for 
a vote in Parliament later this week. If that fails, a centrist group 
that rescued Prodi in June under similar circumstances and that is 
led by former President Francesco Cossiga announced it would support 
the budget, thus at least assuring parliamentary passage. Communist 
Refounding and its mercurial leader, Fausto Bertinotti, have pushed 
Prodi to the brink twice before. The party forced him to offer his 
resignation last year over proposed budget cuts, but then backpeddled 
after the party's rank and file protested. In June, the hard-line 
leftists again refused to follow the prime minister, that time in 
a Parliament vote for NATO expansion, but the government muddled through 
with the help of Cossiga's party. But one of the leaders of that centrist 
group, Clemente Mastella, said Sunday that it would not support the 
government generally, leaving the future of Prodi's coalition highly 
uncertain.

Italian politics have long been enlivened by baroque feuds and shifting 
alliances. And that time-honored tradition may have won the embattled 
government of Prime Minister Romano Prodi a momentary reprieve. A 
leader of Italy's hard-line Marxist faction, known as the Communist 
Refounding Party, resigned Monday in protest over his party's decision 
to reject the government's 1999 budget and imperil Prodi's slender 
majority in Parliament. ``Prodi must realize that his majority no 
longer exists,'' said Armando Cossuta, chairman of the Communist Refounding 
Party, a fringe group that broke with mainstream Communists after 
they overhauled the party following the collapse of the Soviet Union 
in 1991. ``Nevertheless we should do everything possible, until the 
last minute, to save this government and avoid this crisis.'' Cossuta 
was clearly unwilling to join the most hard-line wing of his party 
in withdrawing support from Prodi and risk being branded as having 
torpedoed the first leftist Italian government in 50 years. But the 
leader of the Communist Refounding Party in Parliament, Fausto Bertinotti, 
seems to have no such compunctions. On Friday, he told journalists 
that he was not worried about forcing new elections that could return 
the right to power. ``Sometimes you have to take one step back in 
order to take two steps forward,'' he said with a shrug. Until now, 
however, the communist rank and file have disagreed with that view. 
When Bertinotti forced Prodi to offer his resignation last year over 
proposed budget cuts, the rank and file protested, and he was forced 
to backpedal. Prodi met Monday with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro 
and coalition leaders to devise a strategy. He is expected to go to 
Parliament on Wednesday to open debate on the crisis and seek enough 
votes for the budget. Without it, the Italian central bank is unlikely 
to cut its key lending rates, something Italy must do to get in line 
with Germany and other bigger European neighbors before the introduction 
Jan. 1 of the single European currency, the euro. But even if he gathers 
enough votes to pass the budget, Prodi could still be left without 
a majority. After two and a half years in office, his government is 
the second-longest in the postwar era. But the fragile center-left 
coalition has held together mostly because Italians were united for 
the last two years in an effort to reduce spending, inflation and 
government borrowing to meet the requirements for membership in the 
euro plan. Once that goal was achieved last spring, dissension quickly 
revived. Prodi's backers are hoping that enough members of the Communist 
Refounding Party will break ranks and follow Cossutta to save the 
coalition. If not, Prodi is faced with two unappetizing choices. He 
can resign and seek new elections, which carry the risk of bringing 
the opposition to power. Or he could seek to form a new majority without 
the Communists by seeking an alliance with the small center-right 
party of Francesco Cossiga. Cossiga's party came to Prodi's rescue 
in June, when the hard-line leftists refused to back Prodi on NATO 
expansion. But Prodi has repeatedly said he will govern only with 
the center-left majority that elected him in 1996. Cossiga also suggested 
to reporters Monday that he would not welcome any invitations to join 
a coalition led by Prodi. ``We wouldn't want this majority to get 
stained like Monica Lewinsky's dress,'' he said.

By only one vote, the center-left prime minister of Italy, Romano 
Prodi, lost a confidence vote in Parliament Friday and was toppled 
from power. The collapse of his government after two and a half years, 
the second-longest tenure since World War II, suggested that the chronic 
political instability that marked Italy for decades had sprung back 
to life. Though obliged to tender his resignation, Prodi will remain 
in charge as a caretaker prime minister until a new government is 
formed. He may get a second chance to form a new majority, but even 
if he does, negotiations to that end could take days and even weeks, 
clouding decisions on such urgent issues as the crisis in Kosovo. 
NATO military planners preparing for possible air strikes against 
Yugoslavia had expected to use key air bases in Italy. In his weakened 
position, Prodi will have difficulty persuading Parliament to approve 
NATO strikes. He will have similar problems passing the 1999 budget, 
which is necessary before Italy can cut its lending rates, a requirement 
for joining the single European monetary unit, the euro, on Jan. 1. 
Immediately after Friday's vote of 313-312, in a tense and at times 
raucous session, Prodi met with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro to 
submit his resignation and discuss his options. In the coming days 
Scalfaro will consult with dozens of other leaders to ascertain whether 
Prodi has enough lingering support to try to form a new government. 
If not, the president is expected to turn to another political leader. 
If no compromise is found, Italy could be plunged into early elections. 
But parties of all political stripes may be reluctant to push things 
that far, for opinion polls suggest that voters are no more enamored 
of the center-right opposition parties than they are of the governing 
majority. Prodi, an economist, is admired by his Western allies as 
a down-to-earth leader who vowed to tame Italy's bloated economy and 
reckless government borrowing and actually lived up to his pledge. 
By raising taxes, lowering interest rates and reducing the deficit, 
Italy met the requirements for membership in the euro last spring, 
a feat that only a year before was considered impossible by German 
and French economists. Prodi was helped by a healthy global economy 
and a rare consensus among industrialists, labor unions and taxpayers, 
who feared that exclusion from the euro would condemn Italy to Third 
World status. But his fiscal discipline was not followed by reform 
of a political system that is inherently fragile. There are more than 
40 parties in Italy, and the government's efforts to amend the constitution 
to introduce a two-party system failed. ``Unless the Italian political 
system changes, Italy is condemned to political instability,'' said 
Sergio Romano, a former diplomat and political science professor. 
``The country needs stability and credibility, and that will never 
happen as long as the government is hanging from a thread.'' In 1996 
Prodi won with a patchwork quilt of center-left factions mostly made 
up of Catholic moderates and leftists. He relied on a fringe Marxist 
group, the Communist Refounding Party, for a majority in the lower 
house. And that alliance, fragile from the beginning, finally frayed 
to the breaking point this week. The hard-line leader of Communist 
Refounding, Fausto Bertinotti, said his party would vote against the 
1999 budget and would also end its 28-month-old pact with the center-left 
coalition. That position drove the moderate wing of Communist Refounding, 
worried that a vote against Prodi would open the doors to a center-right 
government, to split away. But the 20-odd deputies who defied Bertinotti 
were not enough to squeeze Prodi through. ``I am not bitter,'' Prodi 
said moments after his defeat. ``Even today I received a lot of support.'' 
In the end the coup de grace was delivered by one of his own, a member 
of the coalition. ``They have won by the treachery of one single person,'' 
Sergio Mattarella, a deputy in Prodi's coalition, angrily told reporters, 
referring to Silvio Liotta, a member of the Italian Renewal Party. 
Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini, who heads that party, said Liotta 
would be expelled. Prodi has often said he would not govern with any 
other majority than the center-left one that elected him in 1996. 
But throughout his tenure, he was forced to seek temporary alliances 
to push through major policy decisions. He struggled to the last to 
try to keep his original majority intact. On Thursday, in an effort 
to woo more moderate Communists to his side, the prime minister, a 
staunch ally of the United States, warned that he would oppose a NATO 
strike aimed at stopping Serbian violence in Kosovo unless the U.N. 
Security Council approved the attack. Washington maintains that NATO 
does not need a new U.N. resolution to order a strike.
