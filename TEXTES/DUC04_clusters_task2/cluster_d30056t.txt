A truck blew up when it drove over a land mine in breakaway Chechnya 
on Friday, killing two people and injuring two others, a news agency 
said. In another mine explosion, a tractor driver was killed Thursday 
in the republic, the Interfax news agency reported, citing Chechnya's 
security officials. Chechnya's ambulance service said that three to 
five people are hospitalized every week with injuries from mine explosions, 
Interfax reported. It did not say how many people are killed. Many 
of the victims are children, who dig the ground to look for ammunition 
left over from Chechnya's two-year independence war against Moscow. 
Russia withdrew its troops in 1996. Chechnya considers itself an independent 
state, although no country, including Russia, has recognized its independence.

Chechen authorities found the decapitated heads of four kidnapped 
foreigners Tuesday along a highway near a remote village after a two-month 
search in the breakaway region in southern Russia. An Associated Press 
reporter saw the severed heads near the village of Assinovskaya, about 
40 kilometers (25 miles) west of Grozny, the Chechen capital. He did 
not see any sign of the bodies. The heads were lined up on a piece 
of cloth along a main highway across southern Russia, NTV television 
reported. The heads were identified as those of the four abducted 
foreigners by Umar Makhauri, who had been a bodyguard assigned to 
the four when they were abducted Oct. 3 by unidentified gunmen in 
Grozny. He said the bodies had not been found. But Chechen government 
officials at the scene said four bodies had been found without giving 
further details. Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov said in Grozny 
that the bodies of four men had been recovered. The hostages _ Britons 
Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey, and Rudolf Petschi, and New Zealand's 
Stanley Shaw _ were engineers. They were working for Granger Telecom, 
a British telephone company, installing 300,000 telephone lines across 
Chechnya. Maskhadov said Chechen officials had caught one of the captors 
Monday and he told police where the hostages were being held. But 
that information reached the other captors, who decided to kill their 
captives, the ITAR-Tass news agency quoted Maskhadov as saying. The 
chief executive of Granger Telecom, Ray Verth, said Tuesday that Chechen 
authorities had mounted a rescue attempt Monday night that went ``tragically 
wrong.'' No other details were available. He said the company had 
``opened a dialogue with the kidnappers and received confirmation 
that the hostages were alive as recently as last week.'' ``Their murder 
is an appalling and barbaric act and our thoughts go out to the families 
to whom we offer our deepest condolences. We are a small tightly-knit 
company and everyone here is in a state of shock,'' Verth said outside 
company headquarters in Weybridge, south of London, where flags were 
flying at half-mast. Spokesmen at the British and New Zealand embassies 
in Moscow said they were checking on reports the four men had been 
killed, but could not comment. The British Foreign Ministry in London 
said it was investigating urgently reports that bodies had been found. 
Chechen acting First Vice Premier Turpal Atgeriyev, who is heading 
the investigation into the killings, said authorities had several 
suspects in the abduction, but have failed to make any progress, according 
to the ITAR-Tass news agency. Eamon Hickey, the father of one of the 
missing men, said he heard the news and was hoping it would not be 
confirmed. ``There is so much rumor and counter-rumor coming from 
out there that we don't know what to think. Obviously we are hoping 
and praying that it does not turn out to be true,'' he said at his 
home in England. Chechen authorities had been searching for the missing 
men for the past two months. British officials said they had not received 
any ransom demand for the missing men. Maskhadov said the deaths of 
the four men were a major blow to Chechnya and its efforts to gain 
international recognition of its independence. He blamed the rash 
of abductions in Chechnya to unidentified ``outside forces'' and their 
Chechen henchmen. ``I am ready to answer before my people and the 
whole world for what happened,'' he was quoted as saying by the Interfax 
news agency. Hostage-takings, usually for ransom, have become common 
in Chechnya since the end of the breakaway republic's two-year war 
for independence from Russia in 1996. But victims are rarely killed. 
Since the beginning of 1998, 176 people have been kidnapped in the 
North Caucasus region of Russia, including dozens of foreigners, and 
90 of them released, officials have said.

The European Union Wednesday condemned the slaying of four foreign 
hostages in Chechnya and said it would raise the issue with Russia's 
foreign minister. In a statement, EU Foreign Affairs Commissioner 
Hans van den Broek ``condemned in the strongest terms the senseless 
killing of the four hostages.'' Van den Broek said the EU was determined 
to see remaining hostages in Chechnya released unharmed. He planned 
to discuss the killings with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, 
who is in Brussels for talks at NATO. The severed heads of the hostages 
_ three Britons and a New Zealander _ were found Tuesday. The men, 
who were working to restore phone services in the breakaway Russian 
republic, had been abducted by gunmen in October.

Chechen police were searching Wednesday for the bodies of four kidnapped 
foreigners who were beheaded during a botched attempt to free them. 
The deaths _ and the ostentatious display of the heads by killers 
_ prompted neighboring Russian regions to close off roads into Chechnya, 
and caused an outpouring of outrage and lament from Russian and foreign 
officials. Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov said Wednesday that one 
alleged kidnapper had been arrested and authorities gleaned enough 
information to launch a rescue operation for the hostages, three Britons 
and a New Zealander. But during the rescue attempt the kidnappers 
panicked and decapitated the captives, Maskhadov said, according to 
Russian media reports. ``A concrete criminal group was identified, 
an organizer of the abductions was arrested and an approximate location 
of the hostages was determined,'' Maskhadov said in a statement. The 
severed heads of the four men were found lined up along a highway 
Tuesday outside Chechnya's capital Grozny, and hundreds of Chechen 
law enforcement officers were searching for the bodies Wednesday. 
``We will take all necessary steps to solve this horrible crime,'' 
said Maskhadov, who has been unable to restore law and order in Chechnya 
since being elected last year. The victims _ Britons Peter Kennedy, 
Darren Hickey, and Rudolf Petschi, and New Zealand's Stanley Shaw 
_ were identified by their former bodyguard. They had been abducted 
by unidentified gunmen Oct. 3 in Grozny. ``He was just making a career 
for himself,'' Hickey's sister Deborah, 21, said Wednesday, fighting 
back tears. ``He was fantastic with electrics and all that sort of 
stuff.'' The family had expected 26-year-old Hickey to be back at 
his parents' pub in Thames Ditton, England, by Christmas. ``Everything 
was going right, everyone was very optimistic'' that the hostages 
would be rescued, she told Britain's ITV. ``The people that have done 
this to him, they deserve exactly the same back.'' The men, pickup

One of four foreigners beheaded by kidnappers in Chechnya claimed 
in a videotape shown today that he and his fellow hostages were British 
spies. The tape was played by Chechen Vice President Vakha Arsanov 
at a news conference in Grozny. He refused to answer questions about 
it, including where or when it was filmed and how or why the government 
had it. The four men, all wearing heavy beards, looked haggard. One, 
Peter Kennedy, claimed they had been sent to Chechnya by the British 
secret service to monitor telephone conversations. Their mission was 
to gather information to stop the spread of Islamic extremism in the 
region, he said in Russian. It was not known whether he was speaking 
under duress. The severed heads of the four hostages were found lined 
up Tuesday along a highway outside Chechnya's capital, Grozny. Chechen 
security forces were still searching today for the bodies. The government 
has said it was trying to rescue the men at the time of their deaths, 
which have outraged Britain and Russia. But its possession of the 
tape was likely to increase suspicions of a government link in the 
frequent kidnappings in Chechnya since it won de facto independence 
from Russia in a 1994-96 war. Most hostages have been released unharmed, 
though dozens remain in captivity. Kennedy and his three colleagues 
_ Darren Hickey and Rudolf Petschi of Britain and Stanley Shaw of 
New Zealand _ were employees of Britain's Granger Telecom. They were 
reportedly setting up a mobile phone network in Chechnya when they 
were abducted by unidentified gunmen Oct. 3 in Grozny. In the tape, 
Kennedy claimed they were using the equipment to monitor phone calls. 
Asked about the spying allegation, British Ambassador to Russia Andrew 
Wood said, ``We don't comment on these things in general but any reasonable 
analysis would show we have no wish to spy on Chechen territory.''

Assailants have abducted Chechnya's top prosecutor, who was investigating 
the killings of four kidnapped foreigners, officials said Friday. 
Mansur Tagirov vanished Thursday evening while returning to Chechnya's 
capital city Grozny from a small village nearby, news reports said. 
Officials at the prosecutor's office said unidentified attackers seized 
Tagirov, and authorities speculated it was the work of an armed band 
seeking the release of one of its members from prison. Tagirov was 
investigating the deaths of four foreigners whose severed heads were 
found Tuesday lined up by a roadside in the breakaway Russian republic. 
The victims _ Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey and Rudolf Petschi of Britain 
and Stanley Shaw of New Zealand _ were abducted Oct. 3 by unidentified 
gunmen in Grozny. It was not clear if there was any link between Tagirov's 
abduction and his investigation into the killings of the four men. 
Meanwhile, Chechen Deputy Prime Minister Turpal Atgeriyev said authorities 
had arrested a man who confessed to kidnapping the four foreigners. 
The suspect was identified as Apti Abitayev, the ITAR-Tass news agency 
said. Chechen security forces were searching Friday for additional 
suspects as well as the bodies of the four foreigners. Atgeriyev said 
he did not place any value in a videotape that showed one of the four 
victims saying he was spying for Britain. ``There are certain methods 
that might force a person to confess to any crime,'' Atgeriyev said. 
The videotape, shown Thursday by Chechnya's vice president, showed 
hostage Peter Kennedy claiming that the four men had been sent to 
Chechnya to listen in on phone conversations in the breakaway republic. 
Chechen officials refused to answer any questions about the tape, 
including where or when it was filmed and how the government got it. 
It was not known if Kennedy spoke under duress. Britain's Embassy 
in Moscow was trying to obtain the tape, spokesman Michael Haddock 
said Friday. Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov will allow British 
government agents to come to Chechnya to investigate the killing, 
Atgeriyev said, according to the Interfax news agency. Since Chechnya's 
two-year independence war with Russia ended in 1996, feuding gangs 
have waged bloody turf wars. Hundreds of people have been kidnapped, 
mostly for ransom. Meanwhile, a Russian soldier taken hostage during 
the war was released after a year of efforts to free him, ITAR-Tass 
said Friday. Alexei Novikov was seized in February 1996. Only a handful 
of soldiers kidnapped during the war are still in captivity. The report 
gave no details of his release.

A French United Nations official kidnapped in southern Russia more 
than 10 months ago has been freed and was flown to Moscow Saturday, 
news reports reported. Vincent Cochetel, 37, who headed the regional 
office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in North Ossetia, 
was seized by three masked gunmen in the region's capital of Vladikavkaz 
on Jan. 29. According to the Interfax news agency, Cochetel was freed 
early Saturday in an operation conducted by the Russian Interior Ministry 
and the regional security forces of the north Caucasus. He was flown 
to Moscow and was waiting for a special plane to take him to Geneva, 
Switzerland, NTV television news said. It was unclear where Cochetel 
was held, in the breakaway republic of Chechnya or in North Ossetia. 
``He was liberated on the border,'' Alexander Dzasokhov, the president 
of North Ossetia, told NTV. French President Jacques Chirac spoke 
to President Boris Yeltsin by telephone and thanked him for Russia's 
part in freeing Cochetel, the Kremlin press service said. His release 
came four days after the severed heads of four foreign hostages were 
found in Chechnya when a government rescue attempt apparently went 
wrong. Chechen security forces are still searching for the men's bodies. 
Chechnya's top prosecutor, who was investigating the killings and 
was apparently kidnapped Thursday, was also released Saturday, Interfax 
said. Mansur Tagirov vanished Thursday evening while returning to

A French United Nations official who was kidnapped in southern Russia 
more than 10 months ago was set free Saturday and flown to U.N. headquarters 
in Geneva. Vincent Cochetel, 37, who headed the office of the U.N. 
High Commissioner for Refugees in the North Ossetia region, was seized 
by three masked gunmen in the regional capital Vladikavkaz on Jan. 
29. Cochetel was freed about two minutes into the predawn operation 
on the border between the republics of Chechnya and Ingushetia, but 
a longer firefight broke out between the kidnappers and Russian security 
forces, the Interfax news agency said. Cochetel was unharmed, but 
he said three of the kidnappers had been killed. In footage of the 
operation broadcast by Russia's NTV television station, Cochetel was 
shown lying face-down, hand-cuffed, behind a white van. Russian security 
officers in masks and camouflage stood over him protectively, then 
dragged him away as gunfire erupted and bullets bounced off the van. 
Two security officers were slightly injured during the operation, 
Interior Ministry spokesman Alexander Mikhailov said, according to 
the ITAR-Tass news agency. No ransom was paid for Cochetel's release, 
Mikhailov said. Cochetel was flown aboard a chartered jet to Moscow, 
where he was met by French Ambassador Hubert Colin de Verdiere and 
U.N. officials. He left Saturday evening for Geneva, where his family 
and colleagues were awaiting him at U.N. headquarters, said Vera Sobolyeva,
