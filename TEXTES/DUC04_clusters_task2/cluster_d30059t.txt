A liberal lawmaker who planned to run for president in Russia's next 
elections was killed Friday in St. Petersburg, a news report said. 
Galina Starovoitova, a member of the lower house of Russia's parliament 
from the reformist party Democratic Russia, was attacked in an apartment 
building along with her aide, the Interfax news agency reported. It 
gave no other details. Starovoitova tried to run for president in 
the 1996 elections but her registration was turned down for technical 
reasons. She had said she would run again in 2000. There have been 
several attacks on prominent figures in St. Petersburg in recent months.

Galina Starovoitova, a member of the lower house of Russia's parliament 
from the reformist party Democratic Russia, was attacked in an apartment 
building along with her aide, Ruslan Linkov, the Interfax news agency 
reported. Linkov was seriously injured, it said. The report gave no 
other details. A police spokesman in St. Petersburg would not comment 
on the report. Starovoitova, 52, tried to run for president in the 
1996 elections but her registration was turned down for technical 
reasons. She had said she would run again in 2000. She served as President 
Boris Yeltsin's aide on ethnic issues and was on the human rights 
committee of the USSR's Supreme Soviet. Born in the Ural Mountains 
city of Chelyabinsk, Starovoitova was trained as a psychologist and 
later received a doctorate in history. She was divorced and had one 
son, according to Who's Who in Russia. There have been several attacks 
on prominent figures in St. Petersburg recently. A finance official 
was attacked earlier this week, a top banker was killed last week, 
and an aide to Russia's parliament speaker was shot in the head last 
month.

Hundreds of people gathered Saturday to mourn the shooting death of 
one of Russia's most prominent women, a potential presidential candidate 
whose killing was widely considered to be politically motivated. President 
Boris Yeltsin said he would personally assume control over the investigation 
into the killing of Galina Starovoitova, who was gunned down Friday 
night as she climbed the stairs to her apartment. An aide was also 
shot and critically wounded. The shooting occurred in a building along 
St. Petersburg's atmospheric Griboedova Canal, site of another notorious 
Russian crime _ the murder that was the central event in Fyodor Dostoevsky's 
19th century masterpiece, ``Crime and Punishment.'' Like that fictional 
crime, which shone a light on social ferment in the St. Petersburg 
of its day, the death of Starovoitova was immediately seized upon 
as a seminal event in the Russia of the late 1990s. ``It is one of 
the black pages in our modern history,'' Vladimir Putin, director 
of the Federal Security Service (FSB) told the Interfax news agency. 
``It doesn't do much to improve our reputation, the reputation of 
the country as a whole.'' Starovoitova, 52, was an outspoken deputy 
in the lower house of parliament who inspired strong feelings from 
both her friends and enemies. A leader of the liberal Russia's Democratic 
Choice party, she was planning to run for president in 2000. Those 
close to her speculated about who might have wanted her dead, with 
some naming various prominent politicians as potential culprits. ``Whose 
path did she cross? The answer is simple: communists and gangsters,'' 
said former Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais. ``These are the 
two kinds of people in whose way she was standing.'' Putin, whose 
agency is in charge of the investigation, cautioned that there was 
still no evidence that her death was a political assassination. Interior 
Minister Sergei Stepashin did not speculate about the motive for the 
crime, but told reporters that it was being investigated under a criminal 
code section that covers terrorism. Arriving at the St. Petersburg 
airport from Moscow, he said: ``I brought with me a team of experienced 
investigators. I think we will clear it up soon.'' Yeltsin sent a 
telegram to Gennady Seleznyov, chairman of parliament's lower house, 
the State Duma, promising that the ``contractors and executors of 
the murder will be found and severely punished,'' The president also 
sent a telegram to Starovoitova's family, in which he called her ``one 
of the most vivid figures in Russian politics,'' who ``consistently 
upheld the lofty ideals of freedom and democracy.'' More than 200 
people gathered in St. Petersburg's Palace Square to remember Starovoitova. 
People hugged quietly as they listened to speeches by her fellow politicians 
and friends. The small stage was adorned with red roses, yellow carnations 
and photographs of the deputy with various people, including the late 
Russian physicist and dissident, Andrei Sakharov. ``We are united 
today by pain, which is bigger than politics,'' said Viktor Krivulin, 
a poet and candidate for the regional legislature. ``Politics, as 
I felt during the past night, has become the art of spitting on the 
soul.'' Others at the gathering said they were sure that Starovoitova 
was killed by those who disliked her outspoken views. ``She had too 
many enemies,'' said Galina Markelova, an aide to the lawmaker. She 
said Starovoitova had received many threats in the past. ``It was 
doubtless a political murder,'' added Vitaly Milonov, the chairman 
of the Young Christian Democrats. Police said two men followed Starovoitova 
and her aide, Ruslan Linkov, 27, and shot them on the stairs of her 
building Friday evening. Linkov was shot twice. He regained consciousness 
after a five-hour operation at the Military Medical Academy, but remained 
in critical condition in intensive care. A pistol with a silencer 
and and automatic rifle were found at the scene, ITAR-Tass said. A 
funeral is scheduled for Tuesday in the settlement of Gorelovo, near 
St. Petersburg.

In modern Russia, the crime was so common as to be mundane. Two thugs, 
armed with machine pistols and silencers, stalked and killed a powerful 
figure, then slipped away into the night. Police vowed to catch them 
and politicians expressed outrage. Usually, that would be the end 
of the story. This time, though, the figure shot was one of the most 
prominent and popular women in Russian politics, a prospective presidential 
candidate with friends in the highest reaches of the Kremlin. As outrage 
mounted Sunday, it seemed clear that the killing of Galina Starovoitova 
was not going to be treated as a routine crime, and some said it might 
turn out to be a watershed event in Russian politics. ``This is impossible 
to tolerate any longer,'' said Grigory Yavlinsky, the leader of Yabloko, 
another reform-oriented party. ``We must stop feeling powerless before 
the increasingly cheeky scum. We cannot go on living as though everything 
is running as usual.'' Starovoitova, a member of parliament and a 
leader of the liberal Russia's Democratic Choice party, was walking 
up the stairs of her apartment building in St. Petersburg with a young 
aide Friday evening. A team of assailants _ police believe it was 
a man and a woman _ appeared behind them and opened fire. Starovoitova, 
shot three times in the head, collapsed and died instantly, authorities 
said. The aide, 27-year-old Ruslan Linkov, was critically wounded, 
but managed to telephone a news agency reporter before losing consciousness. 
Police have recovered two guns, and are hoping that Linkov can provide 
a description of the killers. He had regained consciousness but still 
could not speak Sunday. Although it was still not clear who killed 
Starovoitova or why, the killing had all the earmarkings of a contract 
hit _ a remarkably common crime in post-Soviet Russia. Most of the 
killings involve business deals and the corruption that has swamped 
the government and the economy. Until now, the most notorious of the 
killings was that of popular television host Vladislav Litsyev, who 
was shot outside his Moscow home in 1995. But there have been hundreds 
of others. St. Petersburg has been especially plagued. Last year, 
the city's deputy governor was gunned down on a central St. Petersburg 
street. In the past two months alone, hitmen have claimed the lives 
of a legislative aide, a high-ranking city official and a prominent 
banker. So deeply has the toxin infected Russian society that President 
Boris Yeltsin ordered an investigation last week into reports that 
his Federal Security Service _ the domestic successor to the KGB _ 
had ordered the death of Boris Berezovsky, the nation's most prominent 
businessman and the head of the Commonwealth of Independent States. 
There is no indication that anyone attempted to carry out an assassination 
of Berezovsky. But Yeltsin's order was the equivalent of U.S. President 
Bill Clinton ordering an investigation into whether the FBI was plotting 
to kill Microsoft chairman Bill Gates. Yet, as remarkable as that 
news was, it has been vastly overshadowed by the death of Starovoitova. 
Television news since her death has carried reports of little else. 
Reaction has poured in from virtually every important figure in the 
country, and from surrounding nations. Yeltsin, calling her ``my comrade,'' 
declared that he would personally oversee the investigation into her 
death. There was, in much of the reaction to Starovoitova's death, 
the sense that a line had been crossed. Perhaps it was because she 
was a woman, perhaps because she elicited impassioned support, or 
perhaps because people are simply fed up. But, in more characteristic 
fashion, her death also led to a round of political finger-pointing. 
Colleagues of Starovoitova declared _ without any apparent evidence 
_ that her Communist foes in the Duma, the lower house of parliament, 
were the most likely culprits in her death. Historian Dmitry Likachyov, 
one of the nation's most revered and trusted figures, said her killing 
seemed to signal the ``outburst of a new Red Terror.'' By late Saturday, 
the name-calling had gone so far that Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin 
called a news conference to say there was no evidence that the Communist 
speaker of the Duma, Gennady Seleznyov, was involved in the killing. 
Seleznyov went on television to say he was saddened by her death. 
``But,'' he added, ``I would not like the deputies who sat on the 
same bench with Galina Starovoitova in the State Duma ... to turn 
this into a political show.'' It is too early to know where the recriminations 
and political maneuvering will lead. For now, the only thing certain 
is the Starovoitova has become the latest in a long line of Russian 
martyrs.

A badly wounded aide to a murdered lawmaker regained consciousness 
Monday and was talking to police, who later arrested several suspects 
in raids around the city, officials said. Galina Starovoitova, 52, 
a leader of the liberal Russia's Democratic Choice party, was shot 
dead by unidentified assailants on the stairs of her apartment building 
in St. Petersburg on Friday night. The killing of such a prominent 
politician has caused an uproar in Russia and prompted calls from 
all sides for a crackdown on the country's growing lawlessness. Scores 
of business leaders and others have been gunned down in recent years 
in contract killings that are almost never solved. The lawmaker's 
aide, 27-year-old Ruslan Linkov, was in a ``clear'' mind Monday, testifying 
to investigators, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. Special police 
armed with assault rifles were standing guard at the door of his hospital 
room. Acting on information from the aide, police carried out raids 
and rounded up several suspects, officials said. There were no further 
details. Linkov was critically wounded in the head during the attack 
and later rushed to a hospital where he underwent surgery during the 
weekend. Liberal leaders charged _ without any concrete evidence _ 
that Starovoitova's Communist foes in the Duma, the lower house of 
parliament, were the most likely culprits. Over the weekend, Interior 
Minister Sergei Stepashin even had to call a news conference to say 
there was no evidence that the Communist speaker of the Duma, Gennady 
Seleznyov, was involved in the killing. Seleznyov responded in kind 
on Monday, suggesting that the ``extremists from democratic organizations'' 
might have staged the murder in order to win local elections set for 
Dec. 6, the Interfax news agency reported. The speaker also threatened 
to file a libel suit against a St. Petersburg newspaper, which Starovoitova 
edited. The newspaper recently accused Seleznyov of setting up an 
illegal fund to finance a presidential bid and other shady activities. 
Seleznyov, who has said he might run for president in 2000, denied 
the newspaper's allegations on Friday, calling them an ``outright 
slander.'' Starovoitova's murder had all the traits of a contract 
murder, an increasingly common crime in Russia. Communist leader Gennady 
Zyuganov on Monday used Starovoitova's killing as an occasion to lambast 
the government for its inability to contain soaring crime. ``That's 
a result of the (government's) catastrophic policy aimed at the destruction 
of the state and the nation,'' he said. Starovoitova, of the reformist 
party Democratic Russia, tried to run for president in 1996 but her 
registration was turned down for technical reasons. She had said she 
would run again in 2000. She served as President Boris Yeltsin's aide 
on ethnic issues in 1991-92 _ the only woman in his immediate circle 
_ and later joined the Russian parliament as one of the most vocal 
defenders of liberal reforms. Yeltsin called Starovoitova a ``comrade'' 
and said he would personally monitor the investigation into her killing. 
Starovoitova remarried earlier this year and had one son and a grandson. 
She is scheduled to be buried on Tuesday at the Nikolskoye cemetery 
in St. Petersburg.

A slain Russian lawmaker was honored Tuesday as a martyr to democratic 
ideals in a stately funeral service in which anger mingled freely 
with tears. Afterward, Galina Starovoitova was to be buried alongside 
some of Russia's greatest national heroes. The stirring tribute to 
Starovoitova, a feisty liberal whose killing remains a mystery, was 
indicative of the depth of national feeling over her death. ``To stop 
us, they want to scare us. They will never succeed,'' former Deputy 
Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais said at the funeral for Starovoitova. 
``We will fulfill the goals she sacrificed her life for.'' Hundreds 
of people, including many of the country's most prominent political 
figures, packed the grand Marble Hall of St. Petersburg's Ethnography 
Museum for the funeral. An open casket, cloaked with black ribbons 
and flanked by a military honor guard, stood at the head of the hall. 
At the end of the service, mourners passed grimly past it as classical 
music played. Outside, several thousand more mourners stood in the 
cold, waiting for the service to end so they could file in and pay 
their respects. ``Ordinary people should honor her memory, and make 
sure this never happens again,'' said one man, Vadim Olshevsky, the 
manager of a construction company. But, he added bitterly, ``There's 
little hope of that in our country.'' Among speakers at the service 
were former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Yuri Yarov, President 
Boris Yeltsin's first deputy chief of staff, who represented the president 
at the service. Former Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko was also present. 
Yeltsin, who has said he will personally oversee the investigation 
into Starovoitova's killing, was in a Moscow hospital, recovering 
from pneumonia. ``The shooting in St. Petersburg is a grim lesson 
for the whole of Russia,'' Yarov said. ``Irrespective of real motives 
for that murder, a crime of this magnitude is a political act, and 
society should know all the truth about it.'' One national television 
channel turned over its daylong programming to funeral coverage and 
a memorial tribute. Newspapers carried page after page of coverage 
of her death. Her political party, Russia's Democratic Choice, called 
on all Russians to turn out their lights in her memory for three minutes 
at 8 p.m. Tuesday. Starovoitova was initially going to be buried in 
a simple cemetery in the St. Petersburg suburb where her family lives. 
But as outrage mounted over her killing, the government announced 
that she would be interred in the Alexander Nevsky Monastery in the 
city's center following the funeral at the Ethnography Museum. Among 
those buried at the Alexander Nevsky Monastery are the composers Peter 
Tchaikovsky and Modest Mussorgsky and the author Fyodor Dostoevsky. 
Starovoitova was shot to death Friday evening as she and an aide scaled 
the stairs to her apartment in St. Petersburg. The aide, 27-year-old 
Ruslan Linkov, was seriously wounded, but has been able to provide 
some description of the shooting to police. Acting on his information, 
investigators rounded up several suspects, officials said Monday. 
But a detective later said that investigators had learned nothing 
``serious'' from Linkov, according to the Interfax news agency, and 
there were no further details about whether the suspects were still 
in custody. Igor Kozhevnikov, head of investigations for the Interior 
Ministry, told Interfax on Tuesday that he was confident the case 
would be solved. ``It will take time,'' he said, but added that investigators 
``have tips, they have something to work on.'' Authorities are acting 
on the assumption that Starovoitova's death was a contract hit, a 
common event in post-Soviet Russia. Russian politicians and newspapers 
have speculated wildly about political motives for the killing, but 
police have said they have no idea why someone would have wanted her 
dead. Police said someone fired shots at the apartment of a member 
of the St. Petersburg legislature Monday night, Interfax said. No 
one was hurt. It was not clear whether the shooting was related to 
Starovoitova's death. 
 NYT19981122.0110 
Mourners bearing flowers and candles gathered Sunday outside the house 
on Griboyedova Canal where a Russian legislator, Galina Staravoitova, 
was shot to death on Friday night. A key witness, Ruslan Linkov, 27, 
Mrs. Staravoitova's press aide, was reported to be regaining consciousness 
in a heavily guarded hospital ward where he was taken with gunshot 
wounds to the head and neck. The police say the two were attacked 
in the stairwell of Mrs. Staravoitova's building by two assailants, 
one of them a young woman. The attackers reportedly fled through a 
back entrance to a waiting car. Two guns were found at the scene. 
Friends and relatives say Mrs. Staravoitova, a founder of Russia's 
democratic movement, had received death threats, but the motive for 
the killing remains unclear. ``The choice of the target suggests a 
well-thought out plan,'' said Sergei Kozyrev, vice president of the 
Russian Association of Scientific Societies and a Staravoitova supporter. 
``To kill a woman _ a woman in politics _ that has not happened in 
Russia since Stalin's time.'' Setting aside past feuds, local democratic 
groups said Sunday that they would unite in coming elections to the 
St. Petersburg city council, combining their forces against what they 
say are criminals who have invaded local politics. At a gathering 
Sunday night in Moscow, Yegor Gaidar, a former Russian prime minister 
and a close ally of Mrs. Staravoitova, bitterly rejected suggestions 
that Russia should adopt extraordinary security measures to stem the 
rise in political crime. 
 NYT19981122.0194 
The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Nov. 23: The Russian 
reform movement has produced few leaders with an uncompromising dedication 
to democracy. Galina Starovoitova was one, and her murder in St. Petersburg 
on Friday was a terrible loss for Russia. In a bleak season of economic 
collapse and political timidity, the killing can only heighten fears 
that Russia is slipping into an ugly era of intolerance and political 
violence. Initial evidence suggests that the killing was a political 
assassination. Ms. Starovoitova was gunned down in the lobby of her 
apartment building, shot three times in the head, typical of Russian 
contract killings. She was a member of the Russian parliament and 
a recently declared candidate for governor of the region around St. 
Petersburg. In recent weeks she had spoken out forcefully against 
political extremism, denounced the anti-Semitic statements of a Communist 
parliamentarian and was campaigning aggressively against financial 
corruption in the St. Petersburg municipal government. Ms. Starovoitova's 
activities were fully in character with a career built around principles 
of liberty, tolerance and the rule of law. She championed democracy 
and human rights long before they became politically acceptable in 
Moscow, and courageously stood by Boris Yeltsin and other reformers 
as Russia struggled to find a new political course when the Soviet 
Union disintegrated. An ethnographer by training, Ms. Starovoitova 
proved to be a skillful and effective politician. She first gained 
national attention a decade ago when she set aside her academic work 
about the ethnic history of Leningrad and ran successfully for a seat 
in the Soviet parliament from Armenia, a startling victory for a Russian. 
She later represented St. Petersburg in the Russian legislature. Ms. 
Starovoitova was a woman of irrepressible energy and infectious enthusiasm. 
But her good humor and quick smile belied a steely commitment to combat 
the corruption and ethnic divisions that she correctly considered 
to be the enemies of Russian democracy. The least Yeltsin can do is 
to hunt down her killers and bring them to trial. That would be the 
exception in a nation where political violence is rarely prosecuted. 
Her countrymen can honor her memory by following her example.
