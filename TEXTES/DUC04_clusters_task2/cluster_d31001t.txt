Torturers and bombers who carried out atrocities defending or fighting 
apartheid need counseling to ensure they do not repeat their crimes, 
an expert for South Africa's reconciliation body said Thursday. Addressing 
local and international experts, Charles Villa-Vicencio, research 
head of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, said ignoring the 
psychological needs of those who carried out human rights abuses could 
alienate a potentially dangerous sector of society. ``We must give 
attention to the healing of perpetrators, not just for the sake of 
perpetrators, but for the sake of the nation as a whole,'' he said. 
The conference, organized by the Medical Research Council, is examining 
mental health issues raised by the Truth Commission, which is charged 
with probing crimes committed by all sides in the anti-apartheid struggle. 
As the commission prepares to hand over its final report at the end 
of the month, South Africans are examining its painful and traumatic 
exploration of their bloody past. With the power to grant amnesty 
to many who tortured, bombed or maimed innocent civilians, the process 
has at some stage angered people in nearly all walks of life. Many 
whites see the panel as favoring the black liberation movements, while 
many blacks accuse it of being too soft on former state officials, 
especially top ranking ministers. However, Villa-Vicencio appealed 
for tolerance in dealing with all those who have committed crimes, 
saying that the potential for wrongdoing existed in everyone. ``We 
all, the entire human race, carry with us the capacity for evil,'' 
he said. Many of Thursday's speakers touched on the figure of police 
death squad leader Eugene de Kock, who was given jail terms totaling 
more than 200 years after a killing spree that costs dozens of lives. 
De Kock has applied for amnesty for his crimes. Dan Stein, a specialist 
in neurobiology and stress disorders, said de Kock typified many killers 
from all sides in the conflict by his sheer ``banality of evil''. 
``Many people have found him in interviews to be an ordinary, even 
likeable person,'' he said about the man whom subordinates dubbed 
``Prime Evil.'' Ginn Fourie, a physiotherapist whose student daughter 
was gunned down by black activists in a 1993 attack on a Cape Town 
bar, said it was necessary to help those whose circumstances compelled 
them to do wrong. Struggling to control her tears, Fourie told delegates 
she had attended the amnesty hearings of her daughter's killers and 
supported their successful bid to be freed from long jail sentences. 
After describing how she hugged the three members of the black nationalist 
Pan-Africanist Congress and urged them to seek counseling together 
with their victims, Fourie earned a standing ovation from the 50-strong 
audience. ``We must take the initiative in understanding others and 
start the process of reconciliation and healing our broken land,'' 
she said, her voice shaking with emotion.

A panel probing apartheid-era abuses has accused the African National 
Congress of human rights violations, including torture and bomb attacks, 
the state broadcaster said Monday. The ANC, which led the struggle 
against white rule and now is in power, previously has acknowledged 
it was told to expect implication in right violations. The Truth and 
Reconciliation Commission will release its final report on 2 1-2 years 
of investigation on Thursday. The report was expected to place overwhelming 
blame for the era's abuses on white governments and their brutal security 
services. President Nelson Mandela's office received an advance copy 
on Monday ahead of the handover ceremony, when retired Archbishop 
Desmond Tutu, who chaired the comission, will present Mandela with 
the report. South African Broadcasting Corp. radio said it had been 
leaked a ``preliminary document'' which condemns the ANC as politically 
and morally responsible for gross human rights violations during and 
after the fall of apartheid. An ANC spokesman, Thabo Masebe, said 
he believed the news report referred to a commission letter sent in 
advance ``informing us of its intention to implicate the ANC in gross 
human rights violations.'' Commission officials could not immediately 
be reached for comment. Justice Minister Dullah Omar told journalists 
in Pretoria he had heard the news report, but would not comment. Former 
President F.W. de Klerk, meanwhile, plans to ask a court to prevent 
the Truth Commission report from implicating him in covering up state-sponsored 
terror. ``Obviously we will comply with the ruling of a court,'' Omar 
said, but added he would ``regret'' any court-ordered delay. The ANC 
was nervous enough about the report to request a meeting with commissioners 
earlier this month. The panel refused, to avoid appearing embarrassed. 
The party says the accusations against it likely would center on the 
planting of land mines on border farms, abuses at its military camps 
in Angola and bombings. Omar said he expected the report's conclusions 
to set off debate but added it would ``lay the basis for reconciliation.'' 
 APW19981026.0787 
The institution exploring apartheid's horrors will issue a report 
that finds the African National Congress shares blame for human rights 
violations as it struggled to overcome white rule. The 3,500-page 
report by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission culminates more 
than two years of nationwide hearings. South African media released 
preliminary findings on Monday, three days before its official release 
on Thursday in Pretoria, the capital. The release of the document 
is a milestone in South Africa's transformation from white minority 
rule to democracy. The commission, which has the power to grant amnesty, 
was tasked with promoting reconciliation by laying bare the what and 
why of apartheid-era atrocities. With the ANC now in power and facing 
an election in mid-1999, a condemnation by the commission could prove 
damaging both to its electoral chances and moral standing. There has 
been no doubt that the report's overwhelming blame would be laid on 
white governments and their security forces during the years under 
scrutiny, 1960-1994. Indeed, news reports Monday said the Truth Commission 
would declare apartheid a crime against humanity and acknowledge that 
the ANC and the more radical Pan Africanist Congress were conducting 
a legitimate struggle against the former apartheid state. But in preliminary 
findings sent to the parties last month, the commission also said 
the two movements were ``morally and politically accountable'' for 
gross rights violations, South African Press Association and South 
African Broadcasting Corp. said. The preliminary finding said that 
despite ANC policy against killing civilians, the line between military 
and civilian targets had been blurred, SAPA said. It condemned the 
planting of landmines in rural areas, the execution of enemy agents, 
torture and mistreatment of ANC members in its exile camps and for 
killing political opponents. It said the party must accept responsibility 
for the activities of ANC Women's League president Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, 
Nelson Mandela's former wife, and her Mandela United Football Club, 
accused of killings, torture and kidnappings. The commission also 
said the PAC was guilty of the deaths of civilians in its strategy 
in 1993 to drive white farmers off their land so it could be reclaimed 
by blacks. Justice Minister Dullah Omar, meeting journalists in Pretoria, 
would not comment on the news reports about condemnation of the ANC. 
``I do expect various responses (to the report). I do not expect everyone 
to agree. It will lead to healthy debate,'' he said. He said that 
if the commissioners recommends prosecutions against anyone for abuses, 
it will be up to the national director of prosecutions to decide whether 
to proceed. The director is appointed by the government. The commission's 
work is designed ``to help us establish the rule of law in South Africa, 
and to establish the principle of accountability,'' Omar said. The 
ANC already has prepared the ground for a negative finding, saying 
weeks ago that the commission had warned that harsh judgments were 
in the offing. The ANC was nervous enough about the report to request 
a meeting with commissioners earlier this month. The panel refused, 
to avoid appearing biased. On Monday, it rejected ``with contempt'' 
suggestions ANC officials themselves had leaked the findings. Constand 
Viljoen, leader of the tiny right-wing Freedom Front, said the ANC 
had done so to give the commission credibility by making it more even-handed. 
Publicly, the party has long defended its actions as those committed 
during a ``just war.'' F.W. de Klerk, the last apartheid-era president, 
meanwhile, planned to ask a court to prevent the Truth Commission 
report from implicating him in covering up state-sponsored terror. 
``Obviously we will comply with the ruling of a court,'' Omar said, 
but added he would ``regret'' any court-ordered delay. 
 APW19981028.0231 
A panel investigating apartheid-era atrocities said Wednesday it will 
not implicate the last apartheid president, F.W. de Klerk, in human 
rights abuses after he threatened a court challenge. De Klerk said 
he would sue to block the long-awaited final report of the Truth and 
Reconciliation Commission, which was due for release Thursday. The 
man who helped negotiate the end of apartheid objected to a finding 
by the commission that he was ``an accessory after the fact'' to bombings 
in the 1980s of the headquarters of a church group and of a labor 
federation. Former Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the truth panel's chairman, 
said the commission needed time to prepare to fight the legal challenge, 
and would ``excise'' de Klerk's name from the report to avoid delaying 
its release. ``It upsets me deeply,'' Tutu said. ``We have been scrupulously 
fair to Mr. de Klerk and we reject the contention that we have been 
engaged in a vendetta against him. ``But we must and will respect 
the courts and his rights under the constitution. We fought hard for 
those rights and we can be proud in South Africa that Mr. de Klerk 
now shares in them,'' he said in a statement. ``All we are doing is 
postponing dealing with the matter,'' Tutu later told The Associated 
Press. ``The name will eventually appear after all the hoo-ha has 
died down.'' De Klerk, reached in London, said he could not comment 
before speaking with his lawyers because the matter was in the courts. 
The commission was charged with promoting reconciliation by laying 
bare apartheid's horrors. It has held hearings around the country 
for more than two years, listening to victims and perpetrators seeking 
amnesty. The release of the 3,500-page report represents a milestone 
for South Africa's transformation from white minority rule to democracy. 
De Klerk's challenge was only part of the storm of criticism prompted 
by leaks of the report. The African National Congress, the liberation 
movement that helped defeat apartheid and now runs the country, on 
Tuesday angrily rejected a finding that it too was guilty of human 
rights violations in its armed struggle. The report will be a broad 
and detailed summary of South Africa's human rights history, from 
1960 to 1994, when all-race elections ended white minority rule. It 
will parcel out moral condemnations and recommend individual prosecutions. 
Other threatened legal challenges have led to fewer individuals being 
named as rights violators than planned, The Star of Johannesburg reported 
Wednesday. In commenting on the newspaper report, Tutu said that more 
than 400 people had been notified they would be implicated to give 
them a chance to respond. Only 15 successfully argued themselves out 
of the report, he said. 
 APW19981031.0742 
President Nelson Mandela acknowledged Saturday the African National 
Congress violated human rights during apartheid, setting him at odds 
with his deputy president over a report that has divided much of South 
Africa. The disagreement stems from Thursday's release of the report 
by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission on horrors committed during 
apartheid. Rather than act as a salve and an aid to reconciliation, 
the report has caused divisiveness, even among former comrades-in-arms 
who fought apartheid. As expected, the report called apartheid a ``crime 
against humanity.'' But it also blamed the ANC for gross human rights 
violations during its anti-apartheid struggle, saying the group tortured 
suspected spies and dissidents and killed innocent civilians with 
land mines and bombs. Some suspected traitors were killed in the ANC's 
camps abroad. Mbeki _ who became ANC president last year and will 
likely be elected South Africa's next president in 1999 when Mandela 
retires _ took a hard line Saturday against the report, and indicated 
all ANC members must do the same. ``No member, 5th graf, 1st Ld-Writethru

Criminal prosecutions for atrocities committed during the war against 
white rule could drag on for at least six years, a top prosecutor 
said Monday. Key figures implicated in human rights abuses by the 
Truth and Reconciliation Commission already are under investigation, 
the official, Jan d'Oliveira, told reporters. They include two unnamed 
generals in the apartheid state's security apparatus, President Nelson 
Mandela's ex-wife Winnie Madikizela-Mandela and officials of the African 
National Congress, he said. The remarks by d'Oliveira, who recently 
was appointed a deputy national director of prosecutions, were the 
clearest signal yet that criminal cases would be brought against figures 
accused by the commission of gross human rights violations. The commission 
released its report Oct. 30. It chronicles the human rights abuses 
committed by apartheid governments and their operatives as well as 
by the African National Congress and others fighting the racist system. 
The issue of continuing prosecutions is significant. Many feel that 
dragging on criminal reckonings of the horrors of the apartheid era 
will only prolong bitterness and delay reconciliation. But supporters 
of prosecution feel that denying justice to the victims is a worse 
evil. On a practical level, highly public prosecutions of ANC figures 
could have an impact on national elections next year, when the party 
will seek to consolidate its hold on power. The panel's chairman, 
Archbishop Desmond Tutu, has called for a two-year time limit on prosecutions; 
d'Oliveira called the period ``wholly impractical.'' The prosecutor 
did not name the other targets. ``We have always worked on the principle 
of that we will prosecute the highest rank,'' he said. The commission 
has the ability to grant amnesty to those who admit their misdeeds 
and are found to have acted with political motives. The report said 
individuals who have not sought amnesty should be prosecuted. Madikizela-Mandela 
has not sought amnesty. The commission found her accountable for human 
rights violations committed by her bodyguards, who the report said 
killed and tortured suspected opponents. Madikizela-Mandela was convicted 
in 1991 of kidnapping and being an accessory to an assault on four 
young men. She was sentenced to six years in jail, but paid a dlrs 
3,200 fine on appeal. The ANC official was among the most prominent 
anti-apartheid activists. The two generals were implicated during 
Truth Commission testimony. Prosecutors are ready to move forward 
pending the amnesty application of one.

Facing a court challenge, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission 
said Wednesday that it would withhold, at least temporarily, the parts 
of its final report that implicate South Africa's last apartheid-era 
president, F.W. de Klerk, in illegal acts. De Klerk, 62, who helped 
negotiate the end of South Africa's white supremacist government and 
shared the 1993 Nobel Peace Prize with President Nelson Mandela for 
that work, had objected to a finding by the commission that he was 
``an accessory after the fact'' in the bombings of the headquarters 
of a church group and of a labor federation in the 1980s. The chairman 
of the 17-member panel, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, said that although 
he took such action with ``great reluctance,'' the commission needed 
time to prepare to fight the legal challenge. He said it would take 
de Klerk's name out of 3,500-page report to avoid delaying its release 
Thursday. ``It upsets me deeply,'' he said in a statement. ``We have 
been scrupulously fair to de Klerk, and we reject the contention that 
we have been engaged in a vendetta against him.'' De Klerk's challenge 
was only part of the storm of criticism prompted by leaks about the 
report in the last few days. Within hours of the commission decision 
to withdraw its findings on de Klerk, it was facing the possibility 
of a new suit _ this time from the ruling African National Congress. 
The ANC also wants to block the commission findings about its conduct 
during the liberation struggle. A spokesman for the party, Thabo Masebe, 
said the party would seek an injunction in the morning before the 
report is officially handed over to Mandela. While the commission's 
report is expected to lay overwhelming blame on the former white government 
for atrocities, it has also found the ANC responsible for human-rights 
violations, including the torture and killing of spying suspects, 
bombings in civilian areas and the killing of political enemies, including 
members of the rival Zulu-based Inkhata Freedom Party. The decision 
on de Klerk seems certain to damage the commission's credibility. 
The panel, created as a way of putting South Africa's brutal past 
to rest without the expense and political divisiveness of trials, 
has caused controversy from the start. It has held more than 160 hearings 
throughout the country, listening to both victims and to perpetrators 
seeking amnesty. But many whites say the commission is on a witch 
hunt aiming to humiliate former government officials and Afrikaners 
in general. De Klerk has once before forced the commission officials 
to court and won an apology from them for calling him a liar. Some 
political analysts said Wednesday's events would only further the 
belief that the panel lacks impartiality. ``The withdrawal of the 
findings can't help but be seen as a lack of certainty on their side,'' 
said Sampie Terreblanche, an economist and political analyst at the 
University of Stellenbosch, who has supported the commission. ``Whether 
we like it or not, the whole report gets a knock from this.'' De Klerk's 
spokesman, David Steward, said the former president ``was very confident'' 
that he would win when the case goes to trial in March. ``He is very 
happy to be in the courts now rather than dealing with the Truth Commission,'' 
Steward said. ``The fact that they agreed to withdraw creates the 
definite impression that they specifically concocted a case to involve 
Mr. de Klerk in a negative finding.'' The ANC has accused the commission 
of trying to ``criminalize'' the liberation struggle. ``Whatever the 
efforts to besmirch our struggle by denouncing it as a gross violation 
of human rights,'' the congress said in a statement. ``The ANC and 
the millions of people who were part of this struggle will always 
be proud of what they did to insure that, in the process of the destruction 
of a vile system, they did not themselves resort to vile methods of 
struggle on the basis that the means justified the end.'' There are 
probably few subjects that get South Africans more excited than the 
issue of the Truth Commission and whether it is a worthy cause or 
a waste of money. The events of the last few days have only added 
to the debate. For some, like Pal Martins, 34, a former member of 
the ANC's armed wing, the fact all sides of the political spectrum 
are in an uproar is a good thing. ``The mere fact that everyone is 
complaining means that the Truth Commission has done its work,'' he 
said. But others say that too many questions are being raised about 
the panel's competence. ``The whole affair is beyond the pale, a mockery 
of justice,'' said Roboy Vonholdt, a 56-year-old sheep and ostrich 
farmer who believes that the commission has been a theatrical act. 
``We should all turn our backs on the past and move forward. We need 
them and they need us. Let's all make money and let good economic 
conditions prevail.'' The commission's report is supposed to be a 
broad and detailed summary of South Africa's human rights history, 
from 1960 to 1994, when elections open to all races ended white minority 
rule. It will parcel out moral condemnations and recommend individual 
prosecutions. While de Klerk was alone in court Wednesday challenging 
the commission, Tutu said Wednesday that other threatened legal challenges 
had led to fewer individuals being named as rights violators than 
originally planned. Tutu said that more than 400 people had been notified 
that they would be implicated to give them a chance to respond. Some 
15 successfully argued themselves out of the report or could not be 
reached and were therefore deleted from the report, he said. The commission 
is required by law to give advance notification to anyone it intends 
to implicate in its report. The commission had been expected to say 
that although de Klerk did not order the bombings, he subsequently 
came to know that former Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok and Police 
Commissioner Johan van der Merwe had been involved, but failed to 
report his knowledge to the police. This could open him up to a criminal 
prosecution. De Klerk has not applied for amnesty in this matter or 
any other. de Klerk has said that when he learned about the bombings, 
Vlok and Van der Merwe were already in the process of applying for 
amnesty, and he did not think it was necessary to report the matter.

Following are excerpts from the final report issued by South Africa's 
Truth and Reconciliation Commission on Thursday: PRIMARY FINDING On 
the basis of the evidence available to it, the primary finding of 
the Commission is that: The predominant portion of gross violations 
of human rights was committed by the former state through its security 
and law-enforcement agencies. Moreover, the South African state in 
the period from the late 1970's to early 1990's became involved in 
activities of a criminal nature when, amongst other things, it knowingly 
planned, undertook, condoned and covered up the commission of unlawful 
acts, including the extrajudicial killing of political opponents and 
others, inside and outside South Africa. In pursuit of these unlawful 
activities, the state acted in collusion with certain other political 
groupings, most notably the Inkatha Freedom Party (I.F.P.). . . . 
Certain members of the State Security Council (the state President, 
Minister of Defense, Minister of Law and Order, and heads of security 
forces) did foresee that the use of words such as ``take out,'' ``wipe 
out,'' ``eradicate,'' and ``eliminate'' would result in the killing 
of political opponents. They are therefore responsible for deliberate 
planning which caused gross violations of human rights. P.W. BOTHA 
During the period that he presided as head of state (1978-1989) according 
to submissions made to and findings made by the Commission, gross 
violations of human rights and other unlawful acts were perpetrated 
on a wide scale by members of the South African Defense Force, including: 
The deliberate unlawful killing and attempted killing of persons opposed 
to the policies of the Government, within and outside South Africa. 
The widespread use of torture and other forms of severe ill treatment 
against such persons. The forcible abduction of such persons where 
were resident in neighboring countries. Covert logistical and financial 
assistance to organizations opposed to the ideology of the A.N.C. 
and other liberation movements. . . . INKATHA The Commission finds 
that in 1986, the South African Defense Forces (S.A.D.F.) conspired 
with Inkatha to provide the latter with a covert, offensive paramilitary 
unit (or ``hit squad'') to be deployed illegally against persons and 
organizations perceived to be opposed to both the South African Government 
and Inkatha. The S.A.D.F. provided training, financial and logistical 
management and behind the scenes supervision of the trainees, who 
were trained by the Special Forces unit of the S.A.D.F. in the Caprivi 
Strip. The Commission finds furthermore that the deployment of the 
paramilitary unit in KwaZulu led to gross violations of human rights, 
including killing, attempted killing and severe ill treatment. The 
Commission finds the following people, among others, accountable for 
such violations: Mr. P. W. Botha, Gen. Magnus Malan, Chief Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi. . . . The A.N.C. While it was A.N.C. policy that the loss 
of civilian life should be ``avoided,'' there were instances where 
members of its security forces perpetrated gross violations of human 
rights in that the distinction between military and civilian targets 
was blurred in certain armed actions, such as the 1983 Church Street 
bombing of the South African Air Force headquarters. . . . In the 
course of the armed struggle, the A.N.C., through its security forces, 
undertook military operations which, though intended for military 
or security force targets, sometimes went awry for a variety of reasons, 
including poor intelligence and reconnaissance. The consequences in 
these cases, such as the Magoo's Bar and Durban Esplanade bombings, 
were gross violations of human rights in respect of the injuries to 
and loss of lives of civilians. Individuals who defected to the state 
and became informers and/or members who became state witnesses in 
political trials . . . were often labeled by the A.N.C. as collaborators 
and regarded as legitimate targets to be killed. The commission does 
not condone the legitimization of such individuals as military targets 
and finds that the extrajudicial killings of such individuals constituted 
gross violations of human rights. The commission finds that, in the 
1980's in particular, a number of gross violations were perpetrated 
not by direct members of the A.N.C. or those operating under its formal 
command, but by civilians who saw themselves as A.N.C. supporters. 
In this regard, the Commission finds that the A.N.C. is morally and 
politically accountable for creating a climate in which such supporters 
believed their actions to be legitimate and carried out within the 
broad parameters of a ``people's war'' as enunciated by the A.N.C. 
A.N.C. CAMPS The Commission finds that suspected ``agents'' were routinely 
subjected to torture and other forms of severe ill treatment and that 
there were cases of such individuals being charged and convicted by 
tribunals without proper regard to due process, sentenced to death 
and executed. WINNIE MADIKIZELA-MANDELA The Commission finds that 
Ms. Madikizela-Mandela was central to the establishment and formation 
of the Mandela United Football Club, which later developed into a 
private vigilante unit. It is the Commission's view that Ms. Madikizela-Mandela 
was aware of the criminal activity and the disquiet it caused in the 
community, but chose deliberately not to address the problems emanating 
from the football club. The Commission finds that those who opposed 
Ms. Madikizela-Mandela and the Mandela United Football Club, or dissented 
from them, were branded as informers and killed. The Commission finds 
that Ms. Madikizela-Mandela . . . is accountable, politically and 
morally for the gross violations of human rights committed by the 
Mandela United Football Club. The Commission finds further that Mrs. 
Madikizela-Mandela herself was responsible for committing such gross 
violations of human rights. . . . BUSINESS Business was central to 
the economy that sustained the South African state during the apartheid 
years. Certain businesses, especially the mining industry, were involved 
in helping design and implement apartheid policies. The white agriculture 
industry benefited from its privileged access to land.

The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, Nov. 1: The 3,500-page 
report of the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission, released 
on Thursday, is the most comprehensive and unsparing examination of 
a nation's ugly past that any such commission has yet produced. Drawing 
from the commission's own investigations and the testimony of hundreds 
of applicants for amnesty and 20,000 victims, the report is a detailed 
look at the crimes of the apartheid era, and blames successive white 
governments for the vast majority. It has fulfilled its mandate of 
telling the fullest truth possible, which is one reason that every 
political party in South Africa has denounced it. Besides accusing 
the government of assassinations and bombings, the report criticizes 
the Inkatha Freedom Party for its massacres and collaboration with 
security forces, and blames the African National Congress for the 
murder of civilians and other crimes. It singles out former President 
P.W. Botha, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the Inkatha leader, and Winnie 
Mandela, among others, for detailed treatment of their roles in political 
crimes. One major flaw in the report is the absence of a section accusing 
F.W. de Klerk, the last apartheid president, of knowing about several 
bombings after the fact and keeping silent. It was excised because 
de Klerk is suing the commission. The ANC also sued, unsuccessfully, 
to stop publication. The lawsuits are a disappointing sign that South 
Africa's political parties are not interested in an honest look at 
their past, nor in the free flow of information. The controversy has 
added to widespread complaints that the commission has not helped 
the process of reconciliation. This is wrong. True reconciliation 
_ which occurs when a society is no longer paralyzed by the past and 
people can work and live together _ cannot be based on silence. No 
society can be restored to health by papering over as much pain as 
South Africans have suffered. A noisy and informed debate about complicity 
in the crimes of the apartheid era is necessary, if uncomfortable. 
The report is only part of the Truth Commission's contribution to 
the healing process. The hearings themselves, which allowed victims 
of human rights violations to tell their stories in public, helped 
the country heal and opened the eyes of many whites to the unpleasant 
truth about apartheid. The amnesty process, while permitting many 
important criminals to escape justice, is allowing families to know 
exactly what happened to their loved ones in dozens of cases that 
would likely have never gone to trial in South Africa's fragile judicial 
system. The process of helping the victims with scholarships and other 
necessary aid goes on, although it will not be enough. No commission 
can transform a society as twisted as South Africa's was. But the 
Truth Commission is the best effort the world has seen, and South 
Africa is the better for it. 
 NYT19981107.0056 
The deal that South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission offered 
was simple enough: Confess your crimes, apply for amnesty and you 
will go free. If you don't come forward, you will be prosecuted. After 
more than two years of hearings into apartheid-era atrocities, the 
commission last week unveiled a 3,500-page report naming dozens of 
people it believes were up to their elbows in the gore but never applied 
for amnesty. So the prosecutions should begin soon, right? Not so 
fast. The study was barely in the hands of President Nelson Mandela 
before talk of new amnesty deals had begun. It seems that nearly all 
of South Africa's political parties _ including the ruling African 
National Congress _ have key officials who could end up in the dock 
because of the report. Suddenly, there is lots of talk about how the 
country can't withstand a round of politically divisive trials, and 
many political analysts here are betting that an agreement ``of mutual 
benefit'' is in the offing. Already, three major political parties 
are calling for some kind of new amnesty, and the ANC isn't closing 
the door. ANC spokesman Thabo Masebe said it was ``premature'' to 
talk of a general amnesty, but he acknowledged that the party was 
discussing an amnesty specifically tailored to violence by black South 
Africans against other blacks that littered the KwaZulu/Natal province 
with bodies during the late '80s and into the '90s. In choosing a 
truth commission rather than a Nuremberg-style trial with which to 
close out its brutal past, South Africa hoped for an idealistic reconciliation. 
People would come clean and receive true forgiveness. Society would 
then be able to move on, its wounds cleansed and healed. It was a 
model watched closely around the world by other societies wondering 
how to disentangle themselves from the grudges of a brutal past. But 
given the chance, hundreds of South Africa's perpetrators did not 
come forward. Commission officials themselves say they were frustrated 
by the lack of cooperation, however exhaustive their report may seem. 
It is perhaps too late, however, to press for more. Today's South 
Africa has urgent new problems to deal with _ unemployment, crime, 
white flight, too few schools and hospitals. So it may wind up settling 
for a more pragmatic reconciliation _ one that gives amnesty to the 
unrepentant simply because it's more practical for all concerned to 
move on. In recent years, truth commissions have gained popularity 
in many places, notably Chile, Argentina and El Salvador. But South 
Africa's _ the biggest and most powerful, able to grant amnesty and 
to subpoena witnesses _ was supposed to be the real test. Certainly 
the commission forced the nation to see the gruesome details of its 
past, as sobbing survivors and stone-faced torturers told of smashed 
genitals and near suffocations. And the commission's work added much 
to the knowledge about what happened in South Africa between 1960 
and 1994. But it will be years before the effect of the commission 
can truly be judged. Has anyone really forgiven anyone else? Will 
vendettas persist? No one can answer. One thing seems clear, however: 
Four years after South Africa held its first non-racial elections, 
a growing number of South Africans want to be done with the past. 
Raymond Louw, the publisher of a respected weekly newsletter, Southern 
Africa Report, says a new amnesty proposal could come up during the 
February session of Parliament, in time to remove the issue from next 
year's election campaigns. ``You simply can't have this country torn 
apart by prosecutions,'' he says. ``Everybody is going to be howling 
for an amnesty. They already are.'' Even as Archbishop Desmond Tutu, 
the commission's chairman, delivered the report, he seemed to be anticipating 
a push for a new amnesty and arguing against it. He said such a move 
would be highly unfair to those who came forward. He suggested instead 
that there be a two-year time limit, after which anyone not indicted 
would in effect get amnesty. To be sure, there will be opposition 
to any proposals to limit prosecutions. More than a dozen human rights 
and victims advocacy groups have already banded together to condemn 
such proposals as ``unconscionable.'' The idea for a Truth Commission 
emerged as a compromise from the long negotiations that brought about 
South Africa's peaceful transition from a white supremacist state 
to a non-racial democracy. During the talks, the white National Party 
government pushed for a blanket amnesty, and the ANC refused. In the 
end, only about 250 former police officers came forward, most of them 
foot soldiers. And only two high National Party officials, former 
Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok and Police Commissioner Johan 
van der Merwe, confessed _ to roles in ordering bombings. In its report, 
the commission called the apartheid state the ``primary perpetrator'' 
of gross human rights violations and held such high ranking former 
officials as former President P.W. Botha, his former army chief, Georg 
Meiring, and the former intelligence chief, Niel Barnard, responsible. 
These men, and others of lower rank, have not applied for amnesty 
For the ANC, the most embarrassing prospect is the possible prosecution 
of Mandela's former wife, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, who is accused 
in the report of taking part in a number of assaults and abductions. 
Lesser-known officials could face charges too. The ANC is held responsible 
for at least 76 deaths in KwaZulu/Natal. The ANC's problems are further 
complicated by its efforts to make peace with the largely Zulu-based 
Inkatha Freedom Party. Virtually no one from that party came forward 
to ask for amnesty. Yet the report found that Inkatha, working with 
the white government, was responsible for widespread slaughter in 
KwaZulu/Natal and in the townships around Johannesburg. Inkatha's 
leader, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, and many key party officials stand 
accused of fomenting a wide range of abuses. But prosecuting Chief 
Buthelezi could lead to new warfare in KwaZulu. Part of the reluctance 
to go forward with prosecutions may be the result of still another 
factor: The judicial system is already overwhelmed with rising crime 
and the evidence from the apartheid era is old. So why spend the time 
and the money? At the moment, only one political party is opposed 
to any form of new amnesty _ the tiny but influential Democratic Party, 
a liberal group that was not involved in the violence. Its head, Tony 
Leon, says a new amnesty would only prove that ``the more thuglike 
your behavior, the more you get away with.'' But he concedes that 
his is a lonely voice. ``At this point,'' he says, ``there is little 
enthusiasm for anything but closing the book on the past.''
