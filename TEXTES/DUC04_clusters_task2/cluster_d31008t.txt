At first, the passing bicyclist thought the crumpled form lashed to 
a ranch fence was a scarecrow. But when he stopped, he found the burned, 
battered and nearly lifeless body of Matthew Shepard, an openly gay 
college student who had been tied to the fence 18 hours earlier. On 
Friday, the 22-year-old University of Wyoming student was in a coma 
in critical condition. At Albany County courthouse here, Russell Henderson, 
21, and Aaron McKinney, 22, were arraigned on charges of kidnapping, 
aggravated robbery and attempted first-degree murder. Two women described 
as friends of the men, Kristen Leann Price, 18, and Chastity Vera 
Pasley, 20, have been charged as accessories after the fact to attempted 
first-degree murder. Shepard's friends said that he did not know his 
alleged tormentors. Laramie police say the primary motive was robbery, 
although court papers filed Friday indicate Shepard's homosexuality 
may also have been a factor. Shepard's friends call the attack a hate 
crime. ``He was very open about his sexuality,'' Tina LaBrie, an anthropology 
student here, said of her friend. ``I admired him for that because 
it is very courageous to be yourself even when others disagree.'' 
A few hours before he was beaten, Shepard, a slight 5-foot, 2-inch 
man who wore braces on his teeth, had attended a meeting of the Lesbian, 
Gay, Bisexual, Transgendered Association, said Walter Boulden, a friend 
of Shepard's. ``He was sitting at the bar, having a beer, when two 
men came up and talked to him,'' Boulden, a 46-year-old university 
lecturer of social work here, said today between tears. ``He indicated 
he was gay, and they said they were gay, too.'' ``Now, he is in a 
coma,'' continued Boulden, who visited his friend at a hospital in 
Fort Collins, Colo., on Thursday. ``I don't think anybody expects 
him to pull through.'' Shepard, who spoke Arabic and German, studied 
at a boarding school in Switzerland before moving back to the United 
States to attend the University of Wyoming, the alma mater of his 
father, an oil rig safety inspector in Saudi Arabia. Matthew Shepard 
was born in Casper, the capital of Wyoming's oil belt, and spent much 
of his youth there. But six weeks after returning to Wyoming and enrolling 
as a freshman here, Shepard fell into a depression, said Ms. Labrie 
and her husband, Phillip. Accustomed to life in Europe and Denver, 
this foreign language student who wanted to become a diplomat found 
himself living in this isolated city of 27,000 people. Set in a treeless 
landscape defined by barbed wire fences, grazing cattle and a busy 
freight railroad line, Laramie is a town where pickup trucks outnumber 
sport utility vehicles, where fall entertainment revolves around this 
Saturday's homecoming football game and the start of the hunting season 
in the nearby Medicine Bow mountains. Although Wyoming often bills 
itself as the ``equality state,'' in reference to its being the first 
state to give women the vote, the state legislature has repeatedly 
voted down hate crime legislation on the grounds that it would give 
homosexuals special rights. ``Wyoming is not really gay friendly,'' 
Marv Johnson, executive director of the Wyoming chapter of the American 
Civil Liberties Union, said from Cheyenne. ``The best way to characterize 
that is by a comment a legislator made a few years back, when he likened 
homosexuals to gay bulls as worthless and should be sent to the packing 
plant.'' Shepard joined the campus gay association at the university 
within days. One of his favorite haunts was the Fireside Bar, which 
drew a mixed crowd of college students and rodeo cowboys, gays and 
straights. ``He definitely wasn't drunk when he came in,'' recalled 
the bartender, Matt Galloway. ``He wasn't drunk when he went out.'' 
Calvin Rerucha, the county attorney, charged in court documents today 
that McKinney and Henderson posed as homosexuals and lured Shepard 
out to McKinney's pickup truck. Beating him inside the truck, the 
pair drove him one mile southeast to an isolated part of a new rural 
subdivision, the County Attorney's report charged. There, it said, 
the men tied their captive to a post-and-rail fence and pistol-whipped 
him with a .357 magnum ``while he begged for his life.'' Relatives 
said that Shepard also suffered burns on his body. After nearly beating 
the young man to death, Laramie Police Commander David O'Malley said, 
the assailants stole his wallet and shoes and left him tied to the 
fence. The police commander said that when his officers arrested the 
two men on Thursday, they found in McKinney's pickup truck a .357 
magnum pistol covered with blood and Shepard's shoes and credit card. 
He said they found Shepard's wallet at McKinney's home. The police 
commander said that the two women helped the two men dump their bloody 
clothing, and that they reported hearing the men make anti-gay remarks. 
Ms. Pasley, a freshman art student at the university, lived with Henderson. 
Ms. Price lived with McKinney. The police did not say what the other 
three did for a living. On Friday, friends and Laramie residents struggled 
to understand the incident. Shepard, some said, may have felt a false 
sense of confidence because the local Gay Association completed plans 
on Tuesday night for ``Gay Awareness Week 1998.'' The weeklong series 
of events starts here Sunday with a local observance of ``National 
Coming Out Day'' and a lecture on Monday by Leslea Newman, the author 
of ``Heather Has Two Mommies,'' a book about lesbian families. ``If 
I were a homosexual in Laramie, I would hang low, very low,'' said 
Carla Brown, manager of the Fireside. ``Openly gay behavior is not 
only discouraged, it's dangerous.''

As a gay college student lay hospitalized in critical condition after 
a severe beating here, this small city, which bills itself as ``Wyoming's 
hometown,'' wrestled with its attitudes towards gay men. On Saturday, 
at the University of Wyoming's annual homecoming parade, ``Pistol 
Pete'' and his uniformed brass band were overshadowed by a larger 
group of marchers _ 450 people, many wearing yellow armbands and carrying 
signs in support of the 21-year-old student, Matthew Shepard, who 
suffered severe head injuries in the attack last week. ``Hate is not 
a Small Town Value _ No to Violence and Evil,'' read one sign, as 
watchers applauded. With passersby spontaneously joining the protest 
group, two women held another sign that read, ``No Hate Crimes in 
Wyoming.'' Two candlelight vigils were held Sunday night at churches 
near the campus. At the Poudre Valley Hospital in Fort Collins, Colo., 
where Shepard's health continued to deteriorate, the hospital has 
received so many flowers that nurses have started to distribute bouquets 
to other patients. A vigil at the hospital on Saturday evening drew 
about 500 people. ``We live in the Equality State,'' Shannon Rexroat 
wrote Friday in a special edition of the Branding Iron, the campus 
newspaper. Referring to Wyoming's pioneer heritage as the first state 
to grant women the right to vote, Ms. Rexroat, the campus newspaper's 
editor added: ``That means nothing to me anymore. We live in a state 
where a young man was brutally beaten because he is gay.'' But others 
recalled another side of ``Wyoming's hometown,''which has a population 
of more than 26,000. Jamie Lewis, another editor, said that on Friday 
he was handing out copies of the special edition when a passerby backed 
away from him and used an anti-gay epithet. Last week's brutal assault 
bubbled out of an ongoing climate of hostility toward gay men and 
lesbians, leaders of the local Unitarian church said in a letter published 
Sunday in the city's newspaper, The Laramie Daily Boomerang. ``This 
incident was atypical in its brutality, but not in its underlying 
motive,'' wrote Jeffrey Lockwood and Stephen Johnson. Gay people in 
Laramie, they wrote, ``are frequently assaulted with derision, intolerance, 
insult and hostility _ if not guns and ropes.'' Ric Turley, who dropped 
out of college here after one year in the 1970s, recalled driving 
here to see his family for Christmas in 1993 and seeing a vandalized 
billboard on the main highway. Under a brace of pistols, an advertising 
appeal for a state history museum had been changed, he said, from 
``Shoot a Day or Two,'' to ``Shoot a Gay or Two.'' Turley, who is 
gay and said he only came out after he had left Wyoming, said that 
he immediately complained to the museum. But returning a month later, 
he found the message had not been erased. After complaining to the 
museum for a second time, he said he took a can of black spray paint 
and blotted out the word ``gay.'' ``It was this kind of complacency 
and apathy that allowed this to happen,'' he said of the beating in 
which two local men have been charged, Russell Henderson and Aaron 
McKinney. According to the local police and prosecutors, the two men 
lured Shepard out of a bar by saying they were gay. Then, the Laramie 
police say, the pair kidnapped Shepard, pistol-whipped him with a 
.357 Magnum and left him tied to a ranch fence for 18 hours until 
a passing bicyclist spotted Shepard, who was unconscious. On Sunday, 
the Laramie police said that McKinney had been arrested on Thursday 
at the same hospital in Fort Collins where Shepard was being treated. 
McKinney was being treated for a ``minor'' skull fracture unrelated 
to the fracas with Shepard, said Ben Fritzen, a Laramie police detective. 
President Clinton has condemned the attack, saying on Saturday, ``I 
was deeply grieved by the act of violence perpetrated against Matthew 
Shepard.'' Clinton urged Congress to pass the federal Hate Crimes 
Prevention Act, saying, ``There is nothing more important to the future 
of this country than our standing together against intolerance, prejudice 
and violent bigotry.'' Wyoming is one of 10 states that does not have 
a hate crime law. The latest attempt died in the state Legislature 
in Cheyenne in February. On Saturday, Wyoming's governor, Jim Geringer, 
said he was ``outraged and sickened'' by the attack. Here in Laramie, 
McKinney's father, Bill, also condemned the attack. His pickup truck 
was apparently used in the kidnapping. But he also complained about 
the massive attention by the national media. The national press ``blew 
it totally out of proportion because it involved a homosexual,'' McKinney 
told The Denver Post. `Had this been a heterosexual these two boys 
decided to take out and rob, this never would have made the national 
news.'' Shepard grew up in Casper until his sophomore year in high 
school, when his father, an oil rig safety engineer, was transferred 
to Saudi Arabia. The young man completed high school at a boarding 
school in Lugano, Switzerland, where he learned Italian and German. 
On Saturday, his parents, Dennis and Judy Shepard, released a statement 
from Fort Collins thanking ``the American public for their kind thoughts 
about Matthew.'' ``He is a trusting person who takes everybody at 
face value and he does not see the bad side of anyone,'' the Shepards 
wrote. ``He has always strongly felt that all people are the same, 
regardless of their sexual preference, race or religion.'' Noting 
that their son was born prematurely and that his ``life has often 
been a struggle,'' they added, ``He is physically short in stature, 
but we believe he is a giant when it comes to respecting the worth 
of others.''

Matthew Shepard, the gay college student who was kidnapped and severely 
beaten, died here Monday, five days after he was found unconscious 
on a Wyoming ranch where he had been left tied to a fence for 18 hours 
in near-freezing temperatures. His death, announced at Poudre Valley 
Hospital here, fanned the outrage that followed word of last week's 
attack, spawning nationwide vigils, producing a call for federal hate-crimes 
legislation from President Clinton and fueling debates over such laws 
in a host of Western states, including Wyoming, that have resisted 
them. From Denver to the University of Maryland, people turned out 
to honor the The slight, soft-spoken 21-year-old Shepard, a freshman 
at the University of Wyoming, who became an overnight symbol of anti-gay 
violence after he was found dangling from the fence by a passerby. 
Two men and two women have been charged in the case. The men were 
charged with attempted murder and are expected to face first-degree 
murder charges that could bring the death penalty. ``There is incredible 
symbolism about being tied to a fence,'' said Rebecca Isaacs, political 
director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force in Washington. 
``People have likened it to a scarecrow. But it sounded more like 
a crucifixion.'' Gay leaders hope _ and Christian conservatives fear 
_ that Shepard's death will galvanize Congress and state legislatures 
to pass hate-crime legislation or broaden existing laws. Conservatives 
generally oppose such laws because they favor one group's rights over 
another. In the last two decades, 21 states and the District of Columbia 
have passed laws that increase penalties for crimes that are committed 
because of a person's race, religion, color, national origin, and 
sexual orientation. Another 19 states, including Colorado, do not 
include sexual orientation in their hate-crime laws. Ten states, including 
Wyoming, have no hate-crime laws at all. In Washington, Clinton responded 
to news of Shepard's death by urging Congress to pass the federal 
Hate Crimes Protection Act, which would make federal offenses of crimes 
based on sex, disability and sexual orientation. Wyoming has been 
one of the nation's holdouts, rejecting three hate crimes bills since 
1994, most recently in February. But Monday, after Shepard's death, 
Gov. Jim Geringer appealed to lawmakers to reconsider their opposition. 
``I ask for a collective suggestion for anti-bias, anti-hate legislation 
that can be presented to the Wyoming Legislature for their consideration 
in January,'' Geringer said. The governor met Monday morning with 
Dennis Shepard, the slain student's father, and said that the elder 
Shepard did not want his son's death to become ``a media circus'' 
and that ``we should not use Matt to further an agenda.'' Geringer 
said that Shepard's father also said: ``Don't rush into just passing 
all kinds of new hate-crimes laws. Be very careful of any changes 
and be sure you're not taking away rights of others in the process 
to race to this.'' Leaders of gay rights groups interviewed Monday 
said they would respect the family's privacy by not attending the 
burial in Casper, Wyo., on Saturday. But they added that they hoped 
the death would have an impact on legislators around the nation. ``Matthew's 
death, I hope, will bring about a better and deeper understanding 
of hate crime laws,'' said Elizabeth Birch, executive director of 
the Human Rights Campaign, a lesbian and gay rights group that has 
250,000 members. ``Matthew's death may lead to an awakening in Wyoming 
and in the United States Congress as the need for this legislation.'' 
In 1996, 21 men and women were killed in the United States because 
of their sexual orientation, according to the Southern Poverty Law 
Center, an Alabama group that tracks violence against minorities. 
According to the FBI, sexual orientation was a factor in 11.6 percent 
of the 8,759 hate crimes recorded in 1996. But Christian conservatives 
warn that gay leaders want to use Shepard's death to expand hate rights 
laws and to curtail freedom of speech. ``Hate crimes laws have nothing 
to do with perpetrators of violent crime and everything to do with 
silencing political opposition,'' said Steven Schwalm, an analyst 
with the Family Research Council, a Washington group dedicated to 
defending ``faith, family and freedom.'' ``It would criminalize pro-family 
beliefs,'' Schwalm said. ``This basically sends a message that you 
can't disagree with the political message of homosexual activists.'' 
Agreement came from John Paulk, who was featured this summer in a 
series of advertisements about how he and his wife, Anne, ``overcame'' 
homosexuality through religious conversion. ``We have every right 
to speak out against an agenda that is contrary to Biblical norms,'' 
said Paulk, who describes himself as a homosexuality specialist for 
Focus on the Family, a Christian group in Colorado Springs, Colo. 
``Because we are standing up and opposing the homosexual agenda, we 
are being looked upon as advocating violence against homosexuals, 
when we categorically reject violence against homosexuals.'' Last 
Thursday, the Family Research Council unveiled a series of television 
advertisements that preach the ``healing'' of homosexuality through 
religious conversion. Gay leaders charge that these advertisements 
help create a hostile climate for homosexuals, a climate that can 
lead to violence. Hate crime laws that are on the books in 40 states 
have not impinged on freedom of speech, said Brian Levin, a criminal 
justice professor who directs the Center on Hate and Extremism at 
Stockton College, in Pomona, N.J. Instead, he said, hate crime laws 
send a clear message that society does not tolerate attacks on minorities. 
``We want to deter the broken windows and simple assaults before they 
escalate,'' he said. Referring to murders of homosexuals, he added: 
``These crimes are preventable. Offenders get emboldened if they are 
not punished the first time.'' Levin said that his research indicated 
that homosexuals suffered higher rates of violent crime than the population 
at large. He also said that roughly half of the people who attack 
homosexuals are male, aged 22 or younger. The two men charged in the 
killing of Shephard are both white, Russell Henderson, 21, and Aaron 
McKinney, 22. ``With other crimes, violence is a means to an end. 
With hate crimes, the violence becomes an unstoppable goal,'' Levin 
said. Shepard suffered a dozen cuts around the head, face and neck, 
as well as a massive blow to the back of his skull. ``Because their 
social stature in society, gays are often viewed as appropriate targets,'' 
Levin added. Citing the need for hate crime laws to send a clear message 
to gay bashers, Levin said: ``The discourse in society leaves many 
of these people to believe that what they are doing is socially acceptable.'' 
While some gay leaders saw crucifixion imagery in Shepard's death, 
others saw a different symbolism: the Old West practice of nailing 
a dead coyote to a ranch fence as a warning to future intruders. ``This 
University of Wyoming student was beaten and left to die, tied to 
a fence like an animal because he was honest and open about being 
gay,'' Beatrice Dorhn, legal director of the Lambda Legal Defense 
and Education Fund, said Monday, ``Matthew Shepard's horrible suffering 
and death cannot be dismissed simply as the fault of deranged, isolated 
individuals. His attackers are among millions of Americans who constantly 
hear the message that gay people are not worthy of the most basic 
equal treatment,'' Ms. Dorhn said.

Russell Anderson, 21, and Aaron McKinney, 21, were charged with attempted 
murder and are expected to face first-degree murder charges that could 
bring the death penalty. Their girlfriends, Chastity Pasley, 21, and 
Kristen Price, 18, were charged as accessories. In Denver, mourners 
wrote messages on a graffiti wall as part of national Gay Awareness 
Week. In San Francisco, a giant rainbow flag that symbolizes the gay 
rights movement was lowered to half-staff in the Castro district. 
``There is incredible symbolism about being tied to a fence,'' said 
Rebecca Isaacs, political director of the National Gay and Lesbian 
Task Force in Washington. ``People have likened it to a scarecrow. 
But it sounded more like a crucifixion.'' Police in Laramie, Wyo., 
where the beating took place, have said they believed robbery was 
the primary motive for the attack against Shepard, which occurred 
outside a bar in the town of 27,000. But investigators also said Shepard's 
sexuality may have been a factor. Police said Henderson and McKinney 
lured Shepard from the bar by saying they too were gay and one of 
their girlfriends said Shepard had embarassed one of the men by making 
a pass at him. Monday, police said that after leaving Shepard tied 
to the fence, the men returned to Laramie and picked a fight on a 
street corner with two Hispanic men, Emiliano Morales, 19, and Jeremy 
Herrera, 18. McKinney and Morales suffered head injuries in the brawl; 
McKinney was arrested when he sought treatment at the same hospital

laws to send a clear message to gay bashers, Levin said: ``The discourse 
in society leaves many of these people to believe that what they are 
doing is socially acceptable.'' While some gay leaders saw crucifixion 
imagery in Shepard's death, others saw a different symbolism: the 
Old West practice of nailing a dead coyote to a ranch fence as a warning 
to future intruders. ``This University of Wyoming student was beaten 
and left to die, tied to a fence like an animal because he was honest 
and open about being gay,'' Beatrice Dorhn, legal director of the 
Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, said Monday, ``Matthew Shepard's 
horrible suffering and death cannot be dismissed simply as the fault 
of deranged, isolated individuals. His attackers are among millions 
of Americans who constantly hear the message that gay people are not 
worthy of the most basic equal treatment,'' Ms. Dorhn said.

On the same day Americans learned last week that Matthew Shepard, 
a 5-foot-2, 105-pound gay college student, had been tortured, strung 
up like an animal and left to die on a fence outside Laramie, Wyo., 
the Family Research Council was co-hosting a press conference in Washington. 
It was the latest salvo in a six-month campaign by the religious right, 
with the tacit, even explicit, approval of Republican leaders, to 
demonize gay people for political gain in this election year. This 
particular press conference was to announce a new barrage of ads _ 
a TV follow-up to a summer print campaign _ in which alleged former 
homosexuals who have ``changed'' implore others to do likewise ``through 
the power of Jesus Christ.'' The commercials, gooey in style, end 
with a slogan: ``It's not about hate ... It's about hope.'' But it's 
really about stirring up the fear that produces hate. If these ads 
were truly aimed at gay people, they wouldn't be broadcast at extravagant 
cost to the wide general audience reached by TV, and they wouldn't 
be trumpeted in Washington, insuring free national exposure, three 
weeks before Election Day. The ads themselves, despite the sugar-coating 
of ``hope,'' ooze malice. In one of them, homosexuality is linked 
to drug addiction and certain death by AIDS; all of them implicitly 
posit that homosexuality is itself a disease in need of a cure. Matthew 
Shepard has now been ``cured,'' that's for sure. As his uncle, R.W. 
Eaton, told The Denver Post, the 21-year-old Matt, who aspired to 
a career in diplomacy and human rights, was ``a small person with 
a big heart, mind and soul that someone tried to beat out of him.'' 
Of his nephew's shattered body Eaton said, ``It's like something you 
might see in war.'' And a war it is. Go to the Family Research Council's 
Web site and you will find a proud description of its readiness to 
``wage the war against the homosexual agenda and fight to maintain 
the traditional meaning of `family.''' The head of the Family Research 
Council is Gary Bauer, a GOP power broker and putative presidential 
candidate, who disingenuously goes on talk shows to say that his organization 
hates no one and deplores violence. But if you wage a well-financed 
media air war in which people with an innate difference in sexual 
orientation are ceaselessly branded as sinful and diseased and un-American 
seekers of ``special rights,'' ground war will follow. It's a story 
as old as history. Once any group is successfully scapegoated as a 
subhuman threat to ``normal'' values by a propaganda machine, emboldened 
thugs take over. Two weeks after James Byrd was savagely dragged to 
his death from a pickup truck in Texas in June, I wrote a column about 
an ugly incident outside the GOP state convention in Fort Worth, where 
a mob threatened a group of gay Log Cabin Republicans who were protesting 
discriminatory treatment by their own party. The gay-bashers had been 
directly preceded by steady saber-rattling from Republican politicians: 
Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma had likened James Hormel, a gay nominee 
to an ambassadorship, to David Duke; Pat Robertson had wondered on 
TV if God might wreak havoc on Disney World for its ``Gay Days''; 
the Texas GOP spokesman had likened Log Cabin to the Ku Klux Klan. 
Just two days after this near-brush with violence in Fort Worth, Trent 
Lott was on TV seconding the religious right's condemnation of gay 
people as sinful and sick. A frightened gay Texas Republican who had 
been at the convention melee asked when I interviewed him then: ``Do 
you have to have someone hurt and beat up and dragged from a truck 
to stop this?'' Months later not even the murder in Laramie has moved 
Lott to apologize for his words, and still no major GOP leader dares 
take on its ``religious'' wing and its crusade against people like 
Matthew Shepard. In one of the new ads in that supposedly hate-free 
crusade, an ostensibly loving mother condemns her son for the ``bad 
choice'' of being gay. Is it that mother who speaks for American values, 
or is it Matthew's? ``Go home, give your kids a hug,'' Judy Shepard 
said in a message read by a tearful hospital spokesman who announced 
her child's death early Monday morning, ``and don't let a day go by 
without telling them you love them.'' 
 NYT19981013.0349 
Last Saturday morning, while Matthew Shepard lay comatose from a beating, 
a college homecoming parade passed a few blocks from his hospital 
bed in Fort Collins. Propped on a fraternity float was a straw-haired 
scarecrow, labeled in black spray paint: ``I'm Gay.'' Few people missed 
the message. Three days earlier, Shepard, a gay University of Wyoming 
freshman, was savagely beaten and tied to a ranch fence in such a 
position that a passerby first mistook him for a scarecrow. Tuesday, 
officials at Colorado State University reacted with outrage to the 
fraternity float, opening an investigation and disciplinary procedures 
against the fraternity, Pi Kappa Alpha. The fraternity chapter immediately 
suspended seven members and said they had acted independently. But 
in a week when candlelight vigils for Shepard were being held on campuses 
across the nation, the scarecrow incident highlighted how hostility 
toward gay people often flourishes in high schools and universities, 
gay leaders said Tuesday. ``People would like to think that what happened 
to Matthew was an exception to the rule but, it was an extreme version 
of what happens in our schools on a daily basis,'' said Kevin Jennings, 
executive director of the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network, 
a New York group dedicated to ending anti-gay bias in the schools. 
Shepard, a slightly built 21-year-old, died on Monday morning from 
the injuries suffered in the beating. He never regained consciousness 
after being discovered on the evening of Oct. 7, 18 hours after he 
was lashed to the fence. Two men, Russell Henderson, 21, and Aaron 
McKinney, 22, were arraigned late Monday night on first-degree murder 
charges. Their girlfriends, Chasity Pasley, 20, and Kristen Price, 
18, have been arraigned as accessories after the fact. In response 
to the killing, about 50 candelight vigils were scheduled this week, 
from Texas to Vermont, from Wayne, Neb., to New York City. At the 
Poudre Valley Hospital in Fort Collins where Shepard was in intensive 
care for five days, his parents, Dennis and Judy Shepard, received 
about 6,000 electronic messages of condolences. Tuesday, when funeral 
arrangements were announced for Friday in Casper, Wyo., the hospital 
Web site received 30,000 hits an hour. Friends at the University of 
Wyoming in Laramie, Wyo., have set up The Matthew Shepard Memorial 
Fund to raise money to pressure the state legislature to pass anti-hate 
crime legislation. ``I see his name going down in gay history as a 
catalyst for renewed activism,'' said Matt Foreman, a former Wyomingite 
who directs Empire State Pride Agenda, a gay political organization 
in New York. From around the nation Tuesday, gay leaders stressed 
that campus homophobia is not restricted to college towns in the Rocky 
Mountain West. Last year, in a survey of almost 4,000 Massachusetts 
high school students, 22 percent of gay respondents said they skipped 
school in the past month because they felt unsafe at school, and 31 
percent said they had been threatened or injured at school in the 
past year. These percentages were about five times greater than the 
percentages of heterosexual respondents. The survey was conducted 
at 58 high schools by the Massachusetts Department of Education. In 
a separate study of nearly 500 community college students in the San 
Francisco area, 32 percent of male respondents said they had verbally 
threatened gay people and 18 percent said they had physically threatened 
or assaulted gay people. The study was conducted this year by Karen 
Franklin, a forensic psychologist who is a researcher at the University 
of Washington. Surveys of gay college students conducted in the late 
1980s at Yale University, Oberlin College, Rutgers University and 
Penn State found that 16 percent to 26 percent had been threatened 
with violence, and that 40 percent to 76 percent had been verbally 
harassed, said the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, a lobbying 
group based in Washington. Last year, a student group in Des Moines, 
Iowa, called Concerned Students, recorded hallway and classroom conversations 
at five high schools on 10 ``homophobia recording day.'' They estimated 
that the average Des Moines high school student hears about 25 anti-gay 
remarks every day. ``Nine out of 10 `teaching tolerance' courses weed 
out gays,'' Foreman said. ``There are a lot of people preaching anti-racism 
and anti-semitism. But it is still very much OK to make anti-gay jokes, 
to express anti-gay sentiments.'' In a survey of the nation's 42 largest 
school districts, 76 percent do not train teachers on issues facing 
gay students, and 42 percent do not have policies to protect students 
from discrimination based on sexual orientation, said the Gay, Lesbian 
and Straight Education Network, which conducted the survey last month. 
In Fort Collins, while hospital officials struggled with an electronic 
avalanche of condolences, city police detectives were investigating 
a different kind of e-mail. On Monday, hours after Shepard's death, 
two gay organizations, the Rainbow Chorus and the Lambda Community 
Center, received identical messages applauding Shepard's murder. The 
messages closed with the words: ``I hope it happens more often.''

Matthew Wayne Shepard, the gay student who was beaten in the dead 
of night, tied to a fence and left to die alone, was mourned at his 
funeral Friday by 1,000 people, including many who had never met him. 
``Matt believed that if he had made one person's life better, he had 
succeeded,'' his cousin, the Rev. Anne Kitch, said in a homily that 
was carried beyond the packed pews of St. Mark's Episcopal Church, 
through a filled parish hall, across the street to a packed Presbyterian 
church and across Casper on an AM radio station. ``Judging from the 
world's response,'' she said, ``Matt will have made a difference in 
the lives of thousands.'' As the first snowstorm of the fall blanketed 
Casper, fresh flowers filled the red brick church here where Shepard 
had been baptized as a teen-ager and where he once wore the white 
robes of an Episcopal acolyte. ``There is an image that comes to mind 
when I reflect on Matt on that wooden cross rail fence,'' said the 
Rev. Royce Brown, the pastor of St. Mark's, in a eulogy. ``I replace 
that image with that of another man hung upon a cross. When I concentrate 
on that man, I can release the bitterness inside.'' Shepard, a 21-year-old 
freshman at the University of Wyoming, had dreamed of working one 
day for human rights. In death, he has become a national catalyst 
for a new drive to guarantee for gay people the right to physical 
safety. His death hit a nerve in the nation this week, eliciting dozens 
of candlelight vigils and rallies for tolerance, several statements 
of sadness from President Clinton, and a congressional resolution. 
Thursday, the House of Representatives passed by voice vote a resolution 
that condemned Shepard's killing as ``outrageous'' and that urged 
each member of Congress and every U.S. citizen ``to denounce this 
outrageous murder of another human being.'' In one of the largest 
rallies, about 1,000 people, including members of Congress of both 
parties, gathered on the steps of the Capitol in Washington to condemn 
the Shepherd's killing and to urge passage of a federal bill that 
would add extra penalties to crimes motivated by a victim's sexual 
orientation, gender or disability. House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt 
urged passage of the bill, leading the crowd in a chant of ``Now! 
Now! Now.'' ``We will never forget the love that the world has shared 
with this kind, loving son,'' said Shepherd's father, Dennis, his 
father, outside Casper City Hall, as his mother, Judy, stood by, weeping. 
He said the family was ``touched beyond measure'' by ``the thousands 
of e-mail comments, Web-site messages, phone calls and cards offering 
help, consolation, sympathy and support.'' Before the funeral, about 
a dozen protesters, largely from Kansas and Texas, waved signs with 
anti-homosexual messages. But mourners stood in front of them, singing 
``Amazing Grace'' and holding umbrellas to block the sight of the 
spectacle from friends and family members entering the church. On 
hearing of the protest, Laramie's City Council held an emergency meeting 
Thursday night and unanimously passed an ordinance banning protests 
during funerals. Wyoming Gov. Jim Geringer had warned in advance that 
anti-gay protesters were ``just flat not welcome.'' The governor, 
a Republican, added, ``What we don't need is a bunch of wingnuts coming 
in.'' Shepard was born in Casper and attended elementary school, junior 
high and several years of high school and college here. With flags 
at Casper's public schools flying at half-staff Friday, many mourners 
were his old classmates. Others traveled here, one driving from as 
far away as New Jersey, out of a sense of solidarity. ``I've had a 
pit in my heart and my stomach since I heard this,'' said Steve Pietrangelo, 
who drove 300 miles to wait three hours in cold rain and snow to attend 
the funeral of a man he never met. ``I just wanted to pay my respects 
to him and his family.'' Touching people of all walks of life, Shepard's 
murder has elicited calls for tolerance of homosexuals from unexpected 
quarters. At the University of Wyoming this fall, football players 
will wear yellow and green stickers on their helmets in memory of 
Shepard. Organizers said that yellow signifies tolerance and green 
symbolizes peace. In Casper, a conservative city of 51,000, located 
in the heart of Wyoming's oil belt, tolerance has become the watchword. 
``Prejudice against homosexuals is just as redneck as anti-black bias,'` 
The Casper Star-Tribune, Wyoming's largest newspaper, wrote in its 
main editorial on Sunday. ``Violence against our homosexual friends 
and neighbors has created a most un-American climate of fear in Wyoming 
and the rest of the nation.'' Monday, Jason Marsden, the newspaper's 
political reporter, wrote lovingly that, ``Matthew Shepard is still 
my friend, and not just because we are both members of the loose-knit 
community of gay people striving to make our way in this sometimes 
hostile place called Wyoming.'' ``Matt was very short and hard to 
hug,'' Marsden recalled of the young man who had grown up in Casper. 
``But it was worth trying, because he'd hug you with everything in 
his little, fragile frame.'' In a week of spiritual reflection, Aaron 
Kreifels, the University of Wyoming freshman who found his battered 
classmate Oct. 7, attributed the chance discovery to ``God's plan.'' 
On that afternoon, Kreifels, an 18-year-old architectural engineering 
student, had nearly completed a rigorous six-mile ride on a mountain 
bike up and down Cactus Canyon, in public lands east of Laramie. Kreifels 
recalled in an interview Thursday that his only mishap of the ride, 
``I hit this big limestone rock and did one over the handlebars.'' 
Dusting himself off and looking around in the fading light of the 
day, Kreifels recalled, ``I noticed something out of my eye that looked 
like a scarecrow. I walked around the fence, and as I got closer, 
I noticed the hair.'' Shepard, his hands bound behind his back with 
a nylon cord and tied to a fence post, was lying on the ground, face 
up, unconscious. ``Sometimes I wonder why I found him alive, if he 
was going to die,'' Kreifels reflected, before traveling to spend 
this weekend at home with his parents in Grand Island, Neb. ``But 
I guess God wanted his parents to be with him.''
