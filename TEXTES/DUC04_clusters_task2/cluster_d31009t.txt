ANKARA, Turkey (AP) - Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz on Wednesday faced 
intense pressure to step down after allegations that he interfered 
in a privatization contract and helped a businessman linked to a mobster 
secure loans. Deniz Baykal, leader of the center-left Republican party 
whose backing in parliament helps Yilmaz's minority government, said 
he would withdraw his support unless the premier resigned immediately. 
Two opposition parties threatened to press for a motion to censure 
the government. The allegations were made by businessman Korkmaz Yigit, 
who claimed that Yilmaz and Gunes Taner, the economy minister, had 
encouraged him to buy the state-run bank Turkbank, offering him loans 
from other state banks to ensure that his offer was the highest bid. 
Yigit's allegations were carried Tuesday night on two of his TV channels 
which showed a videotape he had made to explain his version of the 
story before his detention Monday evening for questioning about the 
bidding. Yigit bought the bank at a public auction in August for dlrs 
600 million. The government suspended the privatization last month 
after a lawmaker released an audio tape of a conversation supposedly 
between Yigit and mobster Alaattin Cakici. On that earlier tape, Cakici 
was heard assuring Yigit that he will fend off rival bidders. It was 
not clear who made the tape, which got into the hands of an opposition 
deputy. Yigit claimed Yilmaz and Taner were aware of Cakici's involvement 
in the bidding for the bank but urged him nevertheless to go ahead 
with the bidding. Yilmaz has said that an intelligence report revealing 
Yigit's ties with Cakici only reached him after Yigit won the tender. 
Yigit said the premier had also encouraged him to buy mass-circulation 
national newspaper Milliyet, apparently to ensure the paper's backing 
to his center-right Motherland party in elections next year. Milliyet's 
sale to Yigit was canceled after the scandal. Cakici was arrested 
in France in August. Turkey has requested his extradition. Last month 
State Minister Eyup Asik resigned after allegations he had been in 
close contact with Cakici.

Opposition parties lodged no-confidence motions Wednesday against 
Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz after allegations he interfered in the 
privatization of a bank and helped a businessman linked to a mobster. 
Yilmaz' minority government could go down if the the small, center-left 
Republican Party, which usually gives him the majority he needs in 
parliament, votes against him. The leader of the Republicans, Deniz 
Baykal, urged Yilmaz to resign. But the premier vowed Wednesday to 
stay on, saying he was the victim of a conspiracy. ``This is a plot 
and it can't be a reason for a resignation,'' Yilmaz said, adding 
that he intended to continue the ``struggle against organized crime.'' 
Afterward, Baykal said the Republicans would support a no-confidence 
motion. The leader of the Democratic Turkey Party, Husamettin Cindoruk, 
said his party might withdraw from the governing coalition. He said 
the party would announce its decision Thursday. The political turmoil 
sent the Istanbul stock market plunging 14.9 percent.

Parliament convened Thursday to vote on whether to move toward a no-confidence 
motion that could bring down the government over an organized crime 
scandal. Thursday's vote to put the motion on the agenda will be an 
indication of the government's chances of survival, which are said 
to be extremely slim. If approved, the legislature will debate the 
motions on Monday and hold the no-confidence vote Wednesday. The opposition 
accuses Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz of having ties to organized crime 
and tampering with the privatization of a state bank. He denies the 
charges. ``Ousting the government from power will open the way for 
the struggle against gangs,'' said Lutfu Esengun, a deputy from the 
Islamic Virtue Party, which presented one of the three no-confidence 
motions to Parliament. On Wednesday, 6th graf pvs

Bulent Ecevit, who was asked to form a new government Wednesday, is 
a former prime minister best remembered for ordering an invasion of 
Cyprus in 1974 that made him an overnight hero at home. The invasion, 
after a short-lived coup by supporters of union with Greece, has led 
to the division of the island. Throughout the years, Ecevit, 73, has 
remained a strong defender of the cause of the Turkish Cypriots ``As 
long as Turkey lives, we won't allow the oppression and subordination 
of Turkish Cypriots at the hands of Greek Cypriots,'' he said in July 
1997 during the 23rd anniversary celebrations of the invasion. Ecevit, 
who was prime minister three times since 1974, has over the years 
shed some of the socialist idealism he was known for in the 70s. During 
his tenure as deputy prime minister in a 17-month government that 
was toppled last week over a corruption scandal, he gave his backing 
to the liberal policies of the center-right-led coalition. He often 
said he was carrying out a duty to bring a stable government and spare 
Turkey from crisis - a reference to tensions between a previous Islamic-led 
government and the secular military. Though never a Marxist, Ecevit 
was in his early years viewed with suspicion by big business for espousing 
socialism based on heavy government social benefits and a strong role 
for the state sector in the economy. Recently, however, he has helped 
the government keep on good terms with the IMF, which ordered a strict 
curb on public spending, and approved a number of state sell-offs. 
Under his leadership in the 70's, ties with the United States were 
tense. He has also expressed concern over a U.S.-led multinational 
force based in Turkey that monitors a no-fly zone over Kurdish-controlled 
northern Iraq. He argues it it is helping create a Kurdish state. 
His frequent visits to Iraq to meet with President Saddam Hussein 
have in turn raised suspicion in Washington. Despite a short alliance 
with an Islamic party in 1974, he is a staunch defender of Turkey's 
secular traditions and pushed for a crackdown on Islamic radicalism. 
Ecevit was born in Istanbul in 1925, to an intellectual family and 
studied literature at a prestigious American-run high school. He has 
taken some courses at Harvard University. A former journalist, he 
entered politics in 1957, rising to the leadership of the Republican 
People's Party in 1972, becoming prime minister in 1974, briefly in 
1977 and again in 1978-79. He was barred from politics in the years 
that followed a 1980 military coup. He was imprisoned three times 
for carrying on with political activities despite the ban, mainly 
through his wife of 51 years, Rahsan, who formed the Democratic Left 
Party in 1985 and led it until a democratic reform in 1987 allowed 
Ecevit back into politics. In corruption-tainted Turkish politics, 
he remains known as the leader with the cleanest slate. Not even his 
alliance with Yilmaz who was ousted for alleged ties to the mob and 
rigging the privatization of a bank, tarnished his image.

Premier-designate Bulent Ecevit said Thursday he would persist in 
the difficult task of convincing a key party leader to join forces 
in a secular coalition. Ecevit, who was asked to form a new government 
Wednesday, desperately needs the support of the 99 deputies of ex-premier 
Tansu Ciller's center-right party. Ecevit, a veteran leftist, already 
has the support of another center-right party led by Mesut Yilmaz, 
whose government collapsed last week under the weight of a mafia scandal. 
Mrs. Ciller has not said if she would back an Ecevit-led government 
and her long-standing rivalry with Yilmaz makes Ecevit's job of coalition-building 
difficult. ``I don't give up that easily, neither do I lose hope that 
easily,'' Ecevit told his parliamentary group Thursday. Mrs. Ciller 
could lose grassroot support if she stands in the way of a new government, 
political columnist Ertugrul Ozkok wrote Thursday in daily Hurriyet. 
``This could put her at odds with her classic support base.'' Ecevit 
was expected to meet with Yilmaz on Thursday, and other party leaders 
Friday. Turkey's secular parties are under pressure to join forces 
to keep the Islamic Virtue Party out of power. Virtue is the largest 
party in Parliament, but the all-powerful military is fiercely opposed 
to an Islamic-led government. 
 APW19981209.0696 
The chances for a new, strictly secular government in Turkey faded 
Wednesday when a potential coalition partner insisted on giving the 
Islamic party a share of power. The military, self-appointed guardians 
of Turkey's secular system, is adamantly opposed to the inclusion 
of Islamic Virtue, the largest party in parliament. Premier-designate 
Bulent Ecevit needs Turkey's two-center right parties to hammer together 
a secular coalition, but Tansu Ciller, the ex-premier who commands 
99 votes in parliament, rebuffed him Wednesday. Ecevit already has 
the support of her arch-rival, outgoing Premier Mesut Yilmaz, head 
of the other center-right party. But Mrs. Ciller said Wednesday she 
would not join forces with Yilmaz, whose government collapsed Nov. 
25 over a mafia scandal. Instead, she reiterated her demand for a 
government that would include Virtue. ``We do not oppose Mr. Ecevit's 
premiership. We will support him, but only if all parties represented 
in Parliament are included,'' Mrs. Ciller said. It was not clear what 
Ecevit's next move would be. He might try to form a fragile minority 
coalition. He might also admit defeat and return the task of forming 
the government to President Suleyman Demirel. Demirel could then choose 
any member of parliament to head the government until elections in 
April. 
 APW19981219.0504 
After failing to bring together political rivals in a coalition, Premier-designate 
Bulent Ecevit announced Saturday that he was returning his mandate 
to the Turkish president. In a statement reported by the Anatolia 
news agency, Ecevit said he would see President Suleyman Demirel Monday 
morning. Ecevit, a veteran leftist, was called on to form a cabinet 
over two weeks ago after Mesut Yilmaz' coalition government collapsed 
in a no-confidence vote in Parliament. Deputies accused Yilmaz, who 
has since been serving as acting premier, of entertaining ties with 
the mob and tampering with the sale of a state bank. Refusing any 
alliance with the pro-Islamic Virtue Party, Turkey's largest party 
in Parliament, Ecevit was unable to create a political alliance strong 
enough to survive a confidence vote in the deeply divided legislature. 
Ecevit tried in vain to form a coalition government with two rival 
center-right wing parties -- one led by Yilmaz, the other by former 
Prime Minister Tansu Ciller. Ecevut's alternate efforts to make a 
minority coalition with outside backing for his Democratic Left Party 
from Parliament also failed. Demirel will now have to either ask someone 
else to try to form a government or wait until Jan. 10, when the constitution 
allows him to appoint a caretaker cabinet to lead the country to parliamentary 
elections, now scheduled for April. Such a cabinet would not have 
to face a confidence vote. Or Demirel could choose to leave the current 
caretaker government, headed by Yilmaz, in power until the elections. 
 APW19981221.1044 
President Suleyman Demirel appeared likely to turn to some widely 
trusted lawmaker to form Turkey's next government, after a veteran 
politician abandoned efforts Monday to persuade bickering political 
leaders to support him in a pro-secular coalition. Bulent Ecevit of 
the Democratic Left Party failed in a 3-week-old attempt to form a 
government that could command a majority of votes in Parliament. ``It 
is now clear that no party leader can form a government that can win 
a vote of confidence,'' former Premier Mesut Yilmaz said after talks 
with Demirel. ``We have told the president that we will not hamper 
the appointment of a deputy of Parliament.'' With party leaders unable 
to overcome differences, the new premier-designate would most probably 
be affiliated to a party but be trusted enough by other parties to 
follow an independent line. Parliament Speaker Hikmet Cetin has been 
suggested as a likely candidate. The new appointment would be made 
within days, Yilmaz told reporters. Demirel consulted Turkey's party 
leaders immediately after Ecevit gave up. Most declared themselves 
in favor of a government led by a lawmaker. Only center-right leader 
Tansu Ciller said she wanted a government led by a party leader, and 
made clear she was willing to take on the task. Turkey's parliament 
is split by longstanding animosity between its center-left and center-right 
parties. Yilmaz led the last government, which collapsed in November 
amid allegations he had ties to organized crime and interfered with 
the sale of a state bank. By tradition, Demirel should then have asked 
the leader of Parliament's largest party to form a new government. 
But Demirel broke with custom to keep the Islamic-oriented Virtue 
Party from power. Turkey's staunchly secular military opposes the 
return of an Islamic-led government. Modern Turkey has had only one 
Islamic-led government, formed after 1995 elections, and the military 
pressured it from power for failing to stick to the country's secular 
traditions. Ecevit refused even to consult with the leader of the 
Virtue Party during his efforts to form a government. 
 APW19981228.0740 
Turkey's latest premier-designate got the backing of two key secular 
parties Monday in his efforts to form a broad-based, coalition government, 
on condition that his government stick to Turkey's secular principles. 
The Islamic-oriented Virtue Party, however, withheld immediate support 
for Yalim Erez. News reports said Virtue was holding out for a number 
of Cabinet seats that reflected its standing as the largest party 
in parliament. ``We are neither saying `yes' nor saying `no' at this 
point,'' Virtue leader Recai Kutan said. Erez denied that the two 
had discussed Cabinet posts. Erez, an independent lawmaker, is trying 
to form a coalition government that would include Cabinet members 
from several parties, including Virtue. The coalition would run the 
country only until parliamentary elections set for April. Erez took 
over efforts to form a government last week after veteran leftist 
Bulent Ecevit gave up, unable to convince Turkey's bickering center-left 
and center-right parties to join him in a coalition that excluded 
the Islamic-oriented party. Erez opened talks with various party leaders 
on Monday. He got support from center-right leader Mesut Yilmaz, who 
said his party supported Erez as long as he had Ecevit's backing. 
``As long as our sensitivity toward the secular, democratic regime 
is taken into account, we will do our best to help form the new government 
and ensure it gets a vote of confidence,'' Ecevit said after his own 
talks with Erez. Turkey's strongly secular military is opposed to 
any deal that would bring Virtue to power. It pressured Virtue's predecessor, 
the Welfare Party, out of power last year. Erez is supposed to talk 
Tuesday to center-right Tansu Ciller and to Deniz Baykal, who leads 
a center-left party. ``I am more and more optimistic after every meeting,'' 
Erez told reporters after meeting with the party leaders. Turkey has 
been trying to form a new government since a coalition government 
led by Yilmaz collapsed last month over allegations that he rigged 
the sale of a bank. Yilmaz is now acting premier.

A week after the Turkish government fell in a corruption scandal, 
President Suleyman Demirel on Wednesday asked a veteran left-wing 
politician known for his personal honesty, Bulent Ecevit, to form 
a new government. Ecevit, who served as prime minister three times 
in the 1970s, said he would immediately begin working to fashion a 
government that could command a majority in the faction-ridden Parliament. 
He also suggested that although Parliament has set April 18 as the 
date for a new election, he might seek to remain in power for a longer 
period. ``It is wrong to see this government as simply an election 
government,'' he said. ``There are problems that will not wait until 
an election.'' Military commanders, who hold ultimate power in Turkey, 
have quietly told senior political figures, including Demirel, that 
they do not want a quick election. They fear it will produce a Parliament 
just as divided as the present one, perhaps with the Islamic-oriented 
Virtue Party as the largest bloc. The commanders are also hoping to 
exclude two of the country's leading politicians, outgoing Prime Minister 
Mesut Yilmaz and former Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, neither of whom 
they trust, from posts in the new government. Ecevit must now try 
to build a government that includes their center-right parties but 
not them as individuals. In a meeting this week the country's senior 
policy-making body, the National Security Council, in which military 
officers have a strong say, set three priorities for the coming months. 
It said that whatever government emerges from forthcoming negotiations 
should dedicate itself to fighting religious fundamentalism, Kurdish 
nationalism and criminal gangs that have infiltrated the state apparatus. 
Among Ecevit's immediate challenges will be to resolve a political 
crisis with Italy that broke out last month when the Kurdish rebel 
leader Abdullah Ocalan was arrested in Rome and then asked for political 
asylum there. Turkey wants Ocalan sent here for trial, but Italy says 
it cannot extradite him as long as Turkey retains the death penalty. 
Ecevit (pronounced EH-che-vit) is among the few senior Turkish politicians 
who favors the abolition of capital punishment. Together with Demirel, 
Ecevit is often cited by Turks who complain about the continued dominance 
of a geriatric political elite here. He is 73 and has been in politics 
for most of his adult life. Early in his career Ecevit emerged as 
a spokesman for Turkey's downtrodden masses. Perhaps more than any 
other figure, he legitimized social democratic ideology in a climate 
where leftist sympathies were often considered subversive. At the 
same time, however, he has shown himself to be a fierce nationalist. 
He was prime minister when Turkey sent troops to occupy northern Cyprus 
in 1974 and is still considered a hard-liner on Cyprus. He is also 
uncompromising in his opposition to Kurdish nationalism. During his 
terms as prime minister in the 1970s, Ecevit successfully undermined 
efforts to move Turkey toward membership in the European Union, then 
called the European Economic Community. He considered it an instrument 
of capitalist exploitation. Ecevit has also disturbed the United States 
by flirting with anti-Western ideologies. In the early 1990s, during 
an interval when he worked as a journalist, he traveled to Iraq and 
wrote a series of articles favorable to Saddam Hussein. He recently 
called for better relations between Turkey and Iraq, and maintains 
some of the anti-imperialist positions and suspicion of capitalism 
that he developed in the 1960s. The Democratic Socialist Party, which 
Ecevit heads, is a closely held family fiefdom. He and his wife carefully 
screen applicants for membership and veto those whose personal loyalty 
to Ecevit is suspect. ``During his terms as prime minister in the 
'70s, Ecevit did not appear to be a consensus builder,'' said Ilter 
Turan, a professor of political science at Bilgi University in Istanbul. 
``It seems that nowadays he is more accommodating, so from that perspective 
he may not be bad choice.'' ``On many issues that Turkish society 
is encountering now, he represents an orientation which does not seem 
to be totally in tune with the times,'' Turan said. ``That would include 
his position on issues like privatization, integrating Turkey more 
fully into the international system, and the devolution of central 
authority. He has failed to grasp where the world is heading. He looks 
at and analyzes the world in categories that are no longer useful 
or appropriate.'' Almost alone among Turkish politicians, Ecevit lives 
modestly and has avoided any hint of personal or financial scandal. 
He speaks fluent English, and his reading tastes run to poetry and 
intellectual journals such as The New York Review of Books. He has 
translated the works of T.S. Eliot into Turkish and published several 
volumes of his own poems.
