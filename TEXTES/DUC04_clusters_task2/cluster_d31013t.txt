While veterans and civic leaders devote Wednesday's national holiday 
to honoring fallen soldiers, Remembrance Day has become a chilling 
vigil for Canadians in the front lines of the abortion-rights movement. 
There is immediate fear, because an anti-abortion gunman is believed 
to be at large. And there is long-term anxiety, because even in this 
country where abortions are legal and publicly funded, women may find 
access diminishing. There is speculation the sniper's timing is linked 
to Remembrance Day because some anti-abortion activists use the day 
to commemorate aborted fetuses. Three times since 1994, a sniper has 
used this time of year to fire into the home of a Canadian doctor 
who performs abortion, each time wounding the target. The attacks 
were spread across Canada _ Ontario, Manitoba and British Columbia. 
U.S. and Canadian investigators now believe those attacks were linked 
to two shootings of abortion-providing doctors in upstate New York, 
including the Oct. 23 slaying of Dr. Barnett Slepian at his home near 
Buffalo. An American anti-abortion activist, James Kopp, is wanted 
for questioning about the shootings. Police say they don't know which 
side of the border he is on, fueling uneasiness at clinics and hospitals 
throughout Canada. ``You must realize Canada has the largest undefended 
border in the world,'' said Keith McCaskill, a police inspector in 
Winnipeg, Manitoba, and spokesman for the investigation. Many women's 
clinics have tightened security, and doctors who provide abortions 
have been urged to take precautions. ``I would suggest they be extremely 
aware of their day-to-day goings on, whether during their business 
day or after hours,'' said Toronto Detective Rick Stubbings. Across 
Canada, there have been reports of obstetrician-gynecologists modifying 
their practices or deciding to stop performing abortions. Some wear 
bulletproof vests and hang sheets over windows of their homes. Abortion-rights 
groups say most doctors are not backing down. ``There's a great deal 
of sadness,'' said Susan Fox, director of a clinic in Edmonton, Alberta, 
that provides abortions. ``But there's also a feeling of determination 
that we won't be deterred or scared by these actions.'' Marilyn Wilson, 
executive director of the Canadian Abortion Rights Action League, 
sees a long-term threat because fear of violence may intimidate young 
doctors from entering the field. ``There are almost no doctors who 
have stopped performing these procedures, even under the current reign 
of terror,'' she said. ``But young doctors with families wouldn't 
necessarily want to do this. They may not be willing to put their 
lives at risk.'' The abortion debate is only one of several factors 
contributing to a shortage of obstetrician-gynecologists in Canada. 
The national society that oversees the speciality says there are about 
1,400 doctors in the field, a shortfall of 600, and most are in their 
50s or 60s. The society says long hours and limits on fees paid by 
the public health-care system are causing burnout and deterring medical 
school graduates as they choose a specialty. Another problem is that 
few Canadian medical schools offer training in abortion. Women in 
Canada's big cities generally have adequate access to abortions. Those 
in rural areas often face long journeys, and the province of Prince 
Edward Island prohibits abortions at its six hospitals, forcing women 
there to travel to New Brunswick or Nova Scotia. Abortion-rights groups 
say the situation would improve if the RU-486 abortion pill were available 
in Canada. No drug company has applied for permission to market the 
pill, either fearing boycotts or doubting its profitability. The government 
has been urged to make a public appeal to drug companies, but the 
health department says this can't be done. ``It would be a conflict 
of interest,'' said Bonnie Fox-McIntyre, a department spokeswoman. 
``As a regulator we have to stay at arm's length, so we can judge 
an application impartially.'' Abortion was illegal in Canada until 
1988. Now there is no abortion law of any sort, about 100,000 abortions 
are performed annually, and polls indicate roughly three-quarters 
of Canadians favor pro-choice policies. Yet public support doesn't 
spare doctors from fear. Dr. Henry Morgentaler, who led efforts to 
overturn the old abortion law and whose Toronto clinic was bombed 
in 1993, says he and his colleagues are sacrificing personal freedom 
as they reluctantly increase security measures. ``Unfortunately, doctors 
who are committed to providing these services will have to accept 
a certain diminishment of their enjoyment of life,'' he said.

The slaying of Dr. Barnett Slepian in his home last week eliminated 
the mainstay of the only abortion clinic here, but it has not eliminated 
women's access to abortion. That is because the availability of abortion 
in the Buffalo area, as in much of the United States, is a complex 
reality, one affected by class and education, medical training and 
the personal convictions of individual doctors. Knowledgeable middle-class 
and affluent women here who find themselves with an unwanted pregnancy 
can usually obtain an abortion from their private gynecologists, or 
if a gynecologist has a personal objection to the procedure, through 
a referral to a colleague. Women who are poor, young or uneducated 
and have no such regular relationships with doctors have to rely on 
specialized clinics like the one Slepian worked in, or on hospitals. 
It is this group _ for whom unplanned pregnancies are far more common 
than for prosperous women _ that faces a shrinking universe of possibilities 
as a result of the fear set off by Slepian's killing and the slayings 
of five other doctors and clinic workers since 1993, medical experts 
said. ``If you're well off and well connected, you can get your abortion,'' 
said Dr. Stephen Wear, co-director of the center for clinical ethics 
at the University of Buffalo, which trains doctors for the Buffalo 
area's hospitals. ``For everybody else, it's less and less available.'' 
The number of abortions in the United States has been declining steadily 
since the first years after the Supreme Court's Roe vs. Wade decision 
legalized abortion in 1973, according to the Alan Guttmacher Institute, 
which studies reproductive issues. They now number roughly 1.5 million 
a year, according to reports by Guttmacher, or 1.4 million, according 
to the National Right to Life Committee, the nation's largest anti-abortion 
group, which calculates its estimate partly from the Guttmacher figures. 
The number of providers who identify themselves as performing abortions 
as part of their practice is diminishing as well. A 1994 Guttmacher 
study, the last one published, found that the number had decreased 
18 percent between 1982 and 1992, to 2,380 from 2,908. Moreover, the 
study said, only 12 percent of the nation's residency programs routinely 
offer training in abortions during the first trimester, though many 
do offer elective courses. Laura Echevarria, director of media relations 
for the National Right to Life Committee, contends, however, that 
most teaching hospitals do train gynecologists in procedures for treating 
miscarriages that are similar to those used for performing abortions. 
Only in cosmopolitan and comparatively liberal cities like New York 
does the availability of abortions continue at a steady level, experts 
say, though even in these locales there is concern about the decreasing 
number of young doctors who emerge from residencies fully trained 
in performing abortions. The Guttmacher Institute, which keeps the 
nation's most precise statistics, said that in 1992, the last year 
for which it has figures, there were 142,410 abortions in New York 
that were done by just 151 providers, including 61 hospitals and 44 
clinics. Still, that provider figure greatly understates the number 
of private doctors who perform them in their offices, medical experts 
say. ``Many obstetricians and gynecologists in Manhattan provide abortions 
as part of their palette of services, and have for many years,'' said 
Dr. Richard Hausknecht, the medical director of Planned Parenthood. 
``Rich and middle-class women have always had access to abortions, 
and they always will.'' The major threat to availability in the city 
is less a result of anti-abortion violence than of medical training. 
``The bottom line is that we're facing an impending shortage of physicians 
who are adequately trained and willing to do the procedures,'' said 
Dr. John Choate, chairman of the New York State division of the American 
College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. But the lack of training 
programs is also a result of political pressures on hospitals and 
universities by antagonists of abortion and the same climate of fear. 
``Physicians tend to lie low,'' Choate said. ``They don't publicize 
the fact that they do them. If they do them, they do it quietly out 
of fear for their practice and for their lives.'' One development 
on the horizon that is expected to change the outlook for abortions 
substantially is final federal approval, expected next year, of the 
RU-486 pill, the drug that ends an early pregnancy without the need 
for surgery. When the pill was introduced in France and in Edinburgh, 
Scotland, Hausknecht said, the number of surgical abortions plummeted.

James Kopp, the man the FBI is seeking as a material witness in the 
sniper slaying of Dr. Barnett Slepian, is known to abortion rights 
leaders as an aggressive anti-abortion protester, and law enforcement 
officials say he has been arrested several times in demonstrations 
at abortion clinics. The portrait that emerges of Kopp, 44, from police 
records, studies by researchers on right-wing movements, newspaper 
accounts of protests, and abortion rights advocates, is that of an 
itinerant protester, moving about the country in a series of increasingly 
abrasive protests at abortion clinics. Federal law enforcement officials 
say he is not currently a suspect in the Slepian shooting, and there 
was no indication Wednesday that he had been arrested for any violent 
acts. At several abortion protests, he was charged with trespassing 
or resisting arrest, according to news accounts. One of his arrests 
was in Atlanta during Operation Rescue's huge anti-abortion protests 
there in 1988. While he was in an Atlanta jail, Kopp was given the 
nickname Atomic Dog, which investigators contend links him to the 
violent fringe of the anti-abortion movement, responsible for a series 
of bombings and arsons and seven murders of abortion providers like 
Slepian over the last five years. Responsibility for some of the violence 
_ like the bombing of an abortion clinic in Birmingham, Ala., earlier 
this year, in which an off-duty policeman was killed _ has been claimed 
in notes signed by a shadowy ``Army of God.'' An underground manual 
issued in the name of the Army of God, which describes methods for 
attacking abortion clinics, including how to make homemade C-4 plastic 
explosives, begins with a tribute, by nickname, of a clandestine band 
pledged to stop abortions. The first name under this ``Special Thanks'' 
section is Atomic Dog. The Atlanta police, after searching the hundreds 
of arrest records of the protesters from the summer of 1988, confirmed 
Wednesday night that the date of birth and Social Security number 
of the James Kopp arrested then matched those given out Wednesday 
by the FBI task force in Buffalo investigating the murder of Slepian, 
who was gunned down through the window if his home in suburban Amherst 
on Oct. 23. At the nondescript frame house in St. Albans, Vt., that 
the FBI gave as Kopp's last known address, the current resident, who 
gave his name only as E. Kenny, 20, a shipping clerk, remembered Kopp 
well. He lived there for part of 1990 as the guest of Kenny's parents, 
who were active in the anti-abortion movement, among a group of protesters 
who tried to shut down two abortion clinics in Burlington in stubborn 
demonstrations that year. Kenny remembered Kopp as a ``really nice 
guy,'' who did chores around the place but paid no rent to the parents. 
He sometimes made wooden toys or played video games with Kenny, then 
a child. ``But the focus of his life was the anti-abortion movement,'' 
Kenny recalled. ``He was known among these people as Atomic Dog. It 
wasn't like a name that he had to go to the store or something. But 
if you knew anything about him, that's what you called him.'' Roughly 
95 people were arrested during the protests, according to newspaper 
accounts at the time. ``There were many, many arrests,'' recalled 
Allie Stickney, the president of Planned Parenthood of Northern New 
England. ``It was very big for Vermont. There were Kryptonite locks 
and leaflets from the Army of God and the Lambs of Christ. It was 
clearly a highly organized blockade.'' According to newspaper accounts, 
Kopp was arrested outside a clinic in Levittown, Long Island, in 1991. 
The protests in Atlanta in 1998 appeared to be a turning point for 
a hard-core group of protesters. The Atlanta police cracked down hard 
and carted hundreds of demonstrators off to an isolated prison dormitory 
the called ``the farm.'' Operation Rescue had mounted a series of 
blockades to close down abortion clinics in New York and Philadelphia 
that spring. Atlanta was their high point, but in the face of the 
tough arrest policy, the movement faltered, split apart and stalled. 
``It was a traumatic, life-changing experience,'' said Frederick Clarkson, 
author of ``Eternal Hostility,'' a book on the anti-abortion movement, 
adding that by 1993 with the shooting of Dr. David Gunn, an abortion 
provider in Florida, some of those in the Atlanta jail became the 
nucleus of a group signing a ``justifiable homicide'' statement that 
declared that the use of force was warranted to ``defend the life 
of an unborn child.''

Federal authorities investigating the murder of a Buffalo-area obstetrician 
who performed abortions have identified a Vermont man as a material 
witness to the sniper attack last month and issued a warrant for his 
arrest Wednesday to bring him in for questioning. The man was identified 
as James Charles Kopp, 44, whose last known address was in St. Albans, 
Vt. His whereabouts are not known, investigators said. Investigators 
said Kopp's car was seen near the Amherst, N.Y., home of Dr. Barnett 
Slepian in the weeks before the doctor, whose work at an abortion 
clinic had long made him a target of harassment, was killed. Kopp, 
according to police records and abortion rights groups, has often 
moved about the country in a series of protests at abortion clinics, 
and has been linked to an underground manual that describes methods 
of killing or maiming doctors who perform abortions. Denise O'Donnell, 
the U.S. attorney for the western district of New York, said Kopp 
was not considered a suspect at this time but was believed to have 
information material to the case. She declined to give details on 
what evidence was being sought from Kopp, describing it only as information 
that is contained in a sealed affidavit whose disclosure would compromise 
the ongoing investigation. Ms. O'Donnell said that federal law allowed 
for an arrest warrant for a material witness when a person has information 
that is important to a case. ``If Kopp is found, he would be arrested, 
brought to Buffalo and ordered to provide the required evidence,'' 
Ms. O'Donnell said. ``Then, most likely, the individual would be released.'' 
Slepian, 52, was shot by a sniper firing from outside his home on 
Oct. 23, shortly after returning from an evening service at his synagogue. 
He was standing in his kitchen with his wife and one of his four sons 
when the bullet crashed through a back window. He died two hours later. 
Law enforcement officials said Wednesday's announcement of the material 
witness warrant was in part an attempt to underscore the potential 
danger of anti-abortion violence in advance of Remembrance Day, a 
Canadian holiday that falls on Nov. 11 and that the authorities have 
associated with some anti-abortion crimes. At the same time, the Justice 
Department and the FBI were trying to find ways to step up the federal 
response to violence at abortion clinics in the aftermath of the Slepian 
killing. The officials said that Attorney General Janet Reno would 
soon announce that the Justice Department, aiming to heighten the 
visibility of the federal role in cases that cross state and local 
jurisdictional boundaries, would revive a national investigative effort 
focused on abortion clinic violence. Ms. Reno and senior FBI officials, 
including Robert Bryant, the deputy FBI director, have met with physician 
and abortion rights groups in recent days to discuss ways to enhance 
federal investigative efforts and coordination with local agencies. 
Federal authorities first organized an abortion clinic task force 
in 1995 after the killing of a Florida doctor. The unit, which was 
charged with investigating whether a national conspiracy existed, 
spent nearly two years studying abortion clinic violence. The unit 
disbanded without uncovering a national conspiracy. Law enforcement 
officials said that the unit's operation did help reduce violence 
at abortion clinics and that, in part, the decision to re-establish 
it was prompted by Ms. Reno's desire to send a renewed message to 
anti-abortion extremists that the government would aggressively investigate 
these crimes. Slepian's murder fit the pattern of four earlier sniper 
attacks on abortion doctors in Canada and western New York, dating 
from 1994. None of the attacks have been solved. Bernard Tolbert, 
special agent in charge of the FBI in Buffalo, said at a news conference 
here Wednesday that investigators had not determined whether there 
is a link between the five killings. ``There's a possibility they 
could be linked, but certainly no information,'' he said. Tolbert 
gave little information about the subject of the material-witness 
warrant, except to say that Kopp's black 1987 Chevrolet Cavalier, 
with the Vermont license plate BPE216, was seen near Slepian's home 
beginning several weeks before the murder. ``We don't have any idea 
of where he is,'' Tolbert said of Kopp. ``We are looking for him every 
place we can, every place he might be.'' A photograph of Kopp taken 
in January 1997 has been distributed to law enforcement agencies around 
the United States and Canada. The National Abortion Federation has 
sent out an advisory to clinics around the country about the search 
for Kopp, said Melinda DuBois, assistant director of Womenservices, 
the clinic where Slepian worked. She said naming Kopp a material witness 
in the case had not brought relief to the nurses and other workers 
at the clinic. ``I don't think it makes me or anyone else at the clinic 
feel differently,'' she said. ``I don't want anybody to relax and 
say, `Oh God, they got the guy.' That's easy to happen. I still want 
people to be very vigilant.'' The clinic is the last in the Buffalo 
area that is performing abortions. Slepian was one of only a handful 
of doctors in Buffalo who were still willing to perform the procedure 
in the face of pickets, protesters and threats. Since his death, doctors 
from outside Buffalo have come to the clinic to continue providing 
abortion services.

In July 1988, when Randall Terry drove through the night from his 
home in Binghamton, N.Y., to Atlanta to start the series of anti-abortion 
protests that would finally put his new hard-line group, Operation 
Rescue, onto America's front pages, James Charles Kopp was in the 
van riding alongside him, according to former leaders of Operation 
Rescue who spoke on the condition of anonymity. And, those people 
say, when Terry was arrested on the first day of Operation Rescue's 
``Siege of Atlanta,'' Kopp followed him into jail. Along with more 
than one hundred other Operation Rescue members, according to some 
people who were there, Kopp remained in jail for 40 days and adhered 
to Terry's orders not to give a real name to the police or courts. 
After his release, Kopp returned to Operation Rescue's Binghamton 
headquarters, and was there working alongside Terry as the group's 
power and influence in the anti-abortion movement surged in late 1988 
and 1989, according to the former leaders of Operation Rescue. Now, 
Kopp is being sought by federal and local law enforcement authorities 
for questioning as a material witness in the murder of an obstetrician 
who performed abortions in the Buffalo region. The authorities also 
say he may have information that will help solve four other sniper 
attacks on doctors who performed abortions in Canada and upstate New 
York. Some abortion-rights groups are seizing on Kopp's role in Operation 
Rescue to raise new questions about the connections between the recent 
anti-abortion violence and the hard-line anti-abortion protest groups 
that burst onto the national scene in the late 1980s. For years, the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Justice Department have looked 
in vain for evidence to determine whether a national conspiracy might 
be behind a series of clinic bombings and shootings of doctors and 
other clinic staff members that began in the early 1990s. A federal 
grand jury in Alexandria, Va., that looked into conspiracy allegations 
was ultimately disbanded without finding a national underground. But 
some federal law enforcement officials say they hope that Kopp may 
help provide such a link. In fact, the announcement that law enforcement 
officials are looking for him has been made as Attorney General Janet 
Reno has prepared to revive an interagency task force to look once 
again for possible conspiracies behind anti-abortion crimes. Federal 
law enforcement officials and the authorities say Kopp is not now 
a suspect in the sniper attack on Oct. 23 that killed Dr. Barnett 
A. Slepian near Buffalo. But they say Kopp's car was seen near Slepian's 
home in Amherst, N.Y. in the weeks before the doctor was shot. One 
day after issuing a warrant for Kopp's arrest as a material witness, 
law enforcement officials from at least 10 agencies spanning the United 
States and Canadian border still had not located Kopp Thursday. But 
law enforcement officials said they were pursuing many tips, including 
about 400 that have poured into the FBI's information line: (800) 
281-1184. The police have gone through photographs of abortion protesters 
and clinic workers in Buffalo and around the country, and they are 
also reviewing hundreds of hours of videotapes of demonstrations in 
search of Kopp's face. At this point, officials consider the shooting 
of Slepian to be connected to three attacks in Canada and one in Rochester 
on doctors who provide abortions. The five attacks, all since 1994, 
occurred in the weeks leading up to Nov. 11, Veterans Day _ called 
Remembrance Day in Canada _ a holiday that has become important to 
anti-abortion activists. But the attacks were spread over four years 
and 3,000 miles, from Vancouver, British Columbia, to Buffalo. As 
is the case with many early veterans of Operation Rescue, Kopp was 
transformed into a hard-core anti-abortion militant in jail in Atlanta 
in 1988, according to many people who were in jail with him who insisted 
on anonymity. 
 NYT19981106.0565 
Rosina Lotempio was standing outside abortion clinics here before 
Operation Rescue stormed into town in 1992 for the rowdy Spring of 
Life rallies, in which hundreds were arrested. She was there before 
Lambs of Christ demonstrators came to town in 1993. She was on the 
sidewalk outside Buffalo GYN Womenservices the morning of Oct. 23, 
about 12 hours before Barnett Slepian, the clinic doctor, was fatally 
shot in his home. And she was there Friday, brown rosary beads in 
her hands, a small gold cross on a chain around her neck, quietly 
praying for abortions to stop. ``I'm heartbroken when I have to come 
here,'' Mrs. Lotempio, 58, said as she stood in the cold, wearing 
small black earmuffs and a white turtleneck adorned with a tiny silver 
pin of baby feet. ``It's very difficult out here; I depend on God,'' 
she said, after praying for several moments to decide whether to talk 
to a reporter. The bombings, the fiery rhetoric of abortion opponents 
and the posters of bloody fetuses may capture the attention of the 
news media, but people like Mrs. Lotempio are the foot soldiers in 
the abortion battle. They call themselves street counselors and come 
to the clinic whenever they believe abortions are being performed. 
They pray and they talk to women, hoping to change their minds. Some 
scream profanities. Others, like Mrs. Lotempio, denounce not only 
the violence against doctors and clinics, but also the blocking of 
doors and the shouting of ugly epithets at clinic workers and patients. 
For the approximately 80 abortion opponents here, their protest is 
more like a job than a political activity. There is a schedule. People 
count on them to show up. Mrs. Lotempio, a mother of three and grandmother 
of six, connects her involvement to a conversation in the 1970s in 
which she helped a friend decide to abort an unwanted pregnancy. Two 
decades later, she was haunted by her own question: whether the fetus 
was male or female. ``I just felt horrible and I felt guilty,'' she 
said, tears in her eyes. ``I thought that if I was at the clinic doing 
something, I could make up for that baby's life.'' During Mrs. Lotempio's 
8 a.m.-to-10 a.m. shift Friday, about a dozen people circled the area 
in front of the Buffalo clinic, saying the ``Hail Mary.'' Others take 
her spot on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. She returns on Saturdays, when 
up to 40 people crowd the sidewalk. Similar bands of protesters march 
in front of abortion clinics throughout the United States, and local 
protesters are often joined by bands of people who roam the country. 
At the clinic on Main Street, north of downtown Buffalo, there is 
an odd sense of community. Local protesters greet Dick, the security 
guard, by name. They sometimes see the ``enemy'' _ abortion-rights 
volunteers who escort patients in and out of the clinic _ in the supermarket 
or on the soccer field. Robert Behn, one of the protest leaders, even 
spent two hours talking about abortion over breakfast last year with 
Slepian. And several said they cried when they heard of Slepian's 
death. Most of the protesters, including Mrs. Lotempio, were among 
the thousands of people arrested here in 1992, the height of anti-abortion 
activity in Buffalo. But if Operation Rescue returns, as planned, 
for a Spring of Life reunion in April, Mrs. Lotempio said, she will 
not be there. Instead, she plans to stay in church and pray, to avoid 
the militancy she says she finds uncomfortable. Glenn Murray, a lawyer 
for Womenservices clinic, said: ``When people from out of town show 
up, that is when we feel the most danger. The local people are a known 
quantity. We know most of the local people by name.'' Buffalo has 
been among a handful of hot spots for abortion protesters for the 
last decade. It is a heavily Catholic city where thousands of protesters 
from around the country demonstrated for two weeks in 1992. They failed 
to close abortion clinics, but 500 people were arrested in rallies 
that snarled traffic and drew national headlines. Those rallies, as 
well as earlier protests and continuing sidewalk vigils, have had 
an impact, people on both sides of the abortion issue say. The number 
of clinics performing abortions in the Buffalo area has dropped to 
one from three. And after Slepian's death and the retirement this 
week of another doctor, there are only two doctors in the area for 
whom abortions form a significant part of their practices. The daily 
demonstrators count this as progress. But their perch outside the 
clinic means they witness far more of what they believe are murders 
than what they call rescues. About 30 women a day might go into the 
clinic. After eight years, Mrs. Lotempio can count eight women who 
changed their minds and did not get abortions while she was at the 
clinic. Inside the clinic, the protests just make a hard job harder, 
many clinic workers say. While some demonstrators simply repeat the 
rosary, other protesters call out to patients as they drive into the 
parking lot behind the building, or walk up to the fortresslike front. 
They ask questions like ``Do you know what your baby looks like?'' 
or ``Is it a boy or a girl?'' Sometimes they accuse people of murder 
and torture and sin, or threaten them with damnation. Federal law 
bars protesters from coming within 15 feet of the clinic entrances, 
and from leaning signs against its walls. Some push the limits, frustrating 
clinic workers and guards. The rules protect people from physical 
harassment, but because of the distance, they turn what could be quiet 
conversations into catcalls and taunts. When a patient goes into the 
clinic, the protesters ``take on a different persona,'' said Melinda 
DuBois, director of the Buffalo clinic. ``They scream and yell and 
call us names. They lie. Some days we're immune to it, but other days 
it's just too much.'' Linda Palm, 51, marching at the clinic on Friday, 
said she identified with the clinic patients. When she was 23, she 
said, she struggled with the difficulties of being unmarried and pregnant 
herself, but decided to have her child, and married the father. She 
began protesting in 1990, after attending an abortion protest march 
in Albany.

On the eve of a holiday that has been linked to antiabortion violence, 
the authorities on Tuesday were investigating whether a picture of 
an aborted fetus sent to a Canadian newspaper was connected to last 
month's fatal shooting of a Buffalo, N.Y. doctor who provided abortions 
or four similar attacks in western New York and Canada since 1994. 
The newspaper, the Hamilton (Ontario) Spectator, has received five 
similar packages in the last year, some containing veiled threats 
and several delivered by a man who employees said resembled James 
Charles Kopp, who is wanted for questioning as a witness about the 
Oct. 23 slaying of Dr. Barnett Slepian. Five days after the shooting, 
the Spectator received a package containing an antiabortion flier 
with biographical information about Slepian, including a photograph 
of him that had been crossed out. ``It certainly causes us to be more 
interested than ever in speaking to Kopp,'' said Inspector Keith McKaskill 
of the Winnipeg Police Department, a spokesman for the Canada-United 
States task force investigating the five shootings. Even as they searched 
for Kopp, federal officials were also looking into three letters that 
were received Monday by Catholic and antiabortion organizations in 
Buffalo, Indianapolis and Chicago. Those letters, saying they contained 
the deadly anthrax bacteria, came 10 days after eight similar threats 
to clinics that provide abortions. All the letters appear to be hoaxes, 
and it remains unclear whether they were connected to any of the five 
shootings. Kopp is not a suspect in the shootings. An itinerant antiabortion 
activist whose last known address is in Vermont, he is the subject 
of warrants on both sides of the border. In Canada, he is suspected 
of administrative violations of immigration law; in the United States, 
he is wanted as a material witness in the Slepian case.

By outward appearances, Dorothy Hayes' life seems ordinary. She and 
her family live in a rambling old home on the shore of Lake Ontario, 
and every morning, she gives her husband, John, a peck on the cheek 
before he goes to work. She runs errands, like other suburban moms, 
and spends much of her day taking care of her children. But one thing 
sets Mrs. Hayes apart from her neighbors. As a devoted opponent of 
abortion, the 43-year-old mother of nine regularly plays host to a 
series of traveling speakers, priests and protesters _ many of whom 
have come to Rochester intent upon spreading the word against abortion 
and shutting down clinics that provide it. She is one of thousands 
of people across the country loosely associated with anti-abortion 
groups like the Lambs of Christ who have opened their homes to the 
Lambs' founder, the Rev. Norman Weslin, and other itinerant demonstrators. 
While many _ including Mrs. Hayes _ disavow violent tactics, supporters 
of abortion rights say that people like her bear some responsibility 
when the protesters they help blockade clinics or threaten doctors. 
``These people who provide Father Weslin with food and shelter when 
he comes into town to close the clinics are not innocent,'' said Ann 
Glazier, the director of clinic defense for the Planned Parenthood 
Federation. ``It's just not credible to say they aren't part of the 
extremist activity that is taking place at these clinics. They are 
still guilty of interfering with women's access.'' But Mary Quinn, 
a local organizer for the Lambs of Christ who also offers her home 
to protesters, sees matters in a differing light. ``Taking people 
in like this is an act of Christian charity,'' Mrs. Quinn said. `People 
who travel around the country doing this work are taken in by those 
of us that who don't want to lose their stupid houses. We take in 
these people because they are willing to make the sacrifice.'' Members 
of the Lambs of Christ have been persistent figures in protests at 
the Buffalo women's clinic where Dr. Barnett Slepian worked before 
he was shot to death last month. Although no suspect has been identified 
in the shooting or in several similar attacks in New York and Canada 
over the past several years, officials are looking to question a Vermont 
man whose car was seen near Dr. Slepian's home. That man, James Charles 
Kopp, has participated in abortion protests for more than a decade, 
and often was a house guest of other members of the Lambs of Christ. 
While Mrs. Hayes says she would never so much as obstruct a clinic's 
door, some of those to whom she has given refuge have no qualms about 
doing so. Weslin, the leader of the Lambs of Christ, is one of those 
who has benefited from Mrs. Hayes' hospitality, a modern version of 
the generosity that Christ and the Apostles knew well. He prides himself 
on being arrested more than 60 times during protests in front of medical 
clinics. And throughout the 1980s and early '90s, he was active in 
clinic ``rescues,'' in which protesters tried physically to restrain 
patients trying to enter clinics. Weslin stayed at Mrs. Hayes' home 
only once, beginning in May 1996 when he first came to speak at local 
churches about the anti-abortion movement. But during a stay that 
lasted several months, he was arrested on Federal charges of blocking 
access to a Rochester health clinic where abortions were performed. 
He was later convicted and served two and a half months in prison. 
During the protest outside the clinic, he and several other protesters 
locked themselves in a homemade contraption called ``the oven,'' made 
of cement and iron. It took police officers several hours to lug the 
device to a horse trailer that carted it off. At the same protest, 
one man glued his head to a lock on a gate surrounding the clinic, 
a move some protesters later said was an accident. Abortion opponents 
like Mrs. Hayes and Mrs. Quinn speak of attending peaceful observances 
at abortion clinics and offering prayers for the unborn. They talk 
about counseling women about alternatives to abortion at Roman Catholic 
``pregnancy centers,'' and their support of anti-abortion candidates. 
But they also say they saw nothing wrong with Weslin trying to block 
access to clinics. They describe the activity as peaceful resistance 
meant to stop what they see as murders. Weslin and the other house 
guests of Mrs. Hayes and Mrs. Quinn come recommended from friends 
and members of local Catholic churches, they said, adding that most 
are speakers at local churches or anti-abortion events. And although 
they say they would never take into their homes a stranger wanted 
by the FBI, like Kopp, they concede that they sometimes know little 
about their guests. But Mrs. Hayes and Mrs. Quinn say they know a 
lot about Weslin. An Army veteran, he has been a leader of the anti-abortion 
movement for more than 25 years, they say, and founded a home for 
unwed mothers. Mrs. Hayes said that when she met him, it was obvious 
he was a man of peace who ``had a tremendous devotion to the Blessed 
Mother and basically recognized that we are helpless lambs.'' Barbara 
Fredericks, another local abortion opponent who developed ties to 
the Lambs after Weslin came to town, added that the priest epitomized 
a man of God. ``I just knew when I looked at his holy shoes and his 
simple coat that had been mended 50 times,'' she said. ``He was humble, 
a man who was doing this for a higher purpose, trying to save people 
through sacrifice and prayer.'' opp also has robust defenders among 
the people who housed him as he rode about the country from protest 
to protest. E. Kenny, 20, said that his parents housed Kopp in their 
St. Albans, Vt., home for two years after he spoke at their local 
church in 1988. During Kopp's stay, he was a pleasure, Kenny said, 
always helping around the house. ``He was a nice guy, kind of like 
an uncle to us,'' Kenny said. ``He'd sit around and play video games 
with us and make us model planes out of wood.'' Like Weslin, Kopp 
was consumed by a need to fight abortion and often talked about its 
evils, Kenny said, adding that Kopp was a gentle man who wanted to 
become a Catholic priest. ``He was always in a good mood,'' Kenny 
said. ``He never did anything violent at all.'' Both Kopp and Weslin 
have been arrested repeatedly during abortion protests. The men have 
moved in the same circles and at times found themselves arrested at 
the same events. Mrs. Quinn said that Weslin told her in a recent 
telephone conversation that he knew Kopp. Weslin could not be reached 
for comment, but it is clear that the two men have encountered each 
other. Both faced misdemeanor charges after blocking a Burlington, 
Vt., health clinic in 1990 that Kopp called ``the mill.'' And they 
spent time in the same jail in Atlanta in 1988 after a clinic protest. 
Slepian's death has abortion opponents like Mrs. Hayes and Mrs. Quinn 
worried, both about how the killing is being portrayed in the media 
and what it will do to membership in groups like the Lambs of Christ. 
``For a long time, you felt like the voice in the desert that wasn't 
being heard,'' Mrs. Hayes said. ``And then there was this horrible 
tragedy of this doctor's death becoming the face of the movement. 
``We're about saving lives,'' she said. The FBI has not talked to 
Mrs. Hayes, but Kenny said that agents have spoken to him. The Justice 
Department says that a Federal task force set up this week to investigate 
the killing of Slepian is looking for evidence connecting anti-abortion 
violence at various clinics. ``It's fair to say that when investigating 
these events, we will look at any connection between individuals engaged 
in criminal conduct,'' Myron Marlin, a spokesman for the department, 
said. Many local Catholics associated with the Lambs of Christ have 
tried to distance themselves from the killing of Slepian. They are 
mailing literature saying that the killer does not represent their 
movement. In addition, some people associated with the Lambs are offering 
other possible explanations for the killing. Some say they believe 
that the killer might have been someone overcome by grief after a 
personal experience with abortion. Others wondered whether the shooter 
had tried to wound the doctor to scare him or prevent him from performing 
more abortions. The Lambs also wonder whether abortionist opponents 
are being blamed for a shooting committed by a disgruntled patient. 
One idea gaining currency among the Lambs, and prominently displayed 
on their Web site, suggests that the killing was the result of a plot 
by abortion supporters to discredit abortion opponents just before 
last week's elections. Mrs. Hayes says she doesn't know the truth. 
``There are wackos who travel around and they may be in front of the 
clinic because we are drawn to the same place,'' she said. ``But you 
don't know everyone who shows up and you don't turn to the person 
next to you and tell them they don't belong there.'' Mrs. Fredericks 
said that anyone who would shoot a doctor who provides abortions was 
someone ``who had snapped, perhaps because of the importance of the 
situation.'' Members of the Lambs of Christ and other opponents of 
abortion in Rochester wonder whether the killing of Slepian will hinder 
their efforts. When Weslin first arrived two years ago, he brought 
new focus to a group that often had done little more than counsel 
pregnant women and set up booths on college campuses, they said. ``In 
many cities, they have a priest for life coordinating and leading 
rosary marches'' against abortion, Mrs. Quinn said. ``But with Father 
Weslin coming here, we could finally come together and feel like we 
were doing something sacrificial as a group.'' Mrs. Hayes said that 
she felt the first pull of the movement in the early 1980s, when she 
heard women speak about ``choice'' in regard to abortion. Then she 
saw ``Silent Scream,'' a well-known anti-abortion film that purports 
to show the footage of an abortion. ``What I saw was the end of life,'' 
she said. She began to volunteer at a Catholic pregnancy center where 
she encouraged women ``not to kill their child.'' She also began to 
house unwed mothers and went to stand vigil outside local clinics 
where abortions were performed. Mrs. Hayes looked at her 3-month-old 
daughter, Bernadette, then pointed to the prenatal image of the infant, 
a sonogram taken at 13 weeks that she keeps on her refrigerator door. 
She described what could have been her baby's fate, had she been someone 
else's child. ``Two pounds and two inches ago, she could have been 
a partial-birth abortion,'' Mrs. Hayes said, referring to a controversial 
late-term abortion procedure. ``They have the hardest time getting 
the shoulders out, so they can get to the head and puncture it. ``It's 
brutal, but what do you expect when the purpose is a dead baby? There's 
no question that these doctors are trying to murder a child.''

In the aftermath of last month's deadly sniper attack on an obstetrician 
in upstate New York, Attorney General Janet Reno announced last week 
that she was setting up a new investigative unit to examine the possibility 
that the doctor was the victim of a broader anti-abortion plot. The 
unit, the National Clinic Violence Task Force, will include a dozen 
Justice Department lawyers and involve several law-enforcement agencies. 
But the main work of looking into the shooting of Dr. Barnett Slepian 
in his suburban Buffalo home and how it fits a larger pattern of organized 
violence will be done by the FBI, which has jurisdiction over domestic 
terrorism. For many in the FBI, that's a problem. In contrast to the 
old image of gung-ho FBI agents turning their surveillance machinery 
on political groups, a number of senior FBI agents privately expressed 
misgivings about the attorney general's latest task force, the second 
she has ordered to begin a broad investigation into a conspiracy involving 
anti-abortion violence. FBI officials fear that expanding the investigation 
could drive the agency over the ill-defined boundary that separates 
inquiries into criminal activity from those into political causes 
and unpopular ideas. Today's agents are eager to disassociate themselves 
from the old J. Edgar Hoover days of trampling the civil rights of 
political dissidents in the guise of serious investigations. They 
do not want the agency drawn into the middle of the bitter ideological 
war between anti-abortion groups and abortion rights advocates, who 
have long asserted the existence of an organized campaign against 
clinics and doctors. Many of those calling for government help were 
once themselves subjects of FBI interest as anti-war and civil rights 
activists. Senior agency officials, including Director Louis Freeh, 
were starting their careers in the early 1970s and watched in dismay 
as the FBI was shaken by revelations about Cointelpro, the counterintelligence 
program that allowed agents to spy on, burgle, wiretap and infiltrate 
anti-war and civil rights groups like Students for a Democratic Society 
and the Student Nonviolence Coordinating Committee. Some officials 
are dubious that a conspiracy exists to kill doctors who perform abortions. 
They came up empty handed when Reno ordered the first federal inquiry 
in 1994 after the killing of a Florida doctor and his bodyguard. The 
Justice Department conducted a two-year grand jury investigation; 
agents pursued some anti-abortion activists using surveillance teams. 
But investigators never found a specific plot against abortion clinics 
and staff members. Violence at abortion clinics is only part of the 
problem. The FBI has in recent years found itself thrown into a minefield 
of politically tinged cases involving the volatile worlds of anti-government 
militias, environmental and Christian extremists, white separatists, 
animal rights activists and Islamic fundamentalists. ``The FBI is 
very quick to jump from investigating crime to investigating political 
association,'' said David Cole, a law professor at Georgetown University. 
``When you move from investigating crimes to investigating groups, 
that all-important nexus to criminal conduct gets lost, the focus 
gets broader and broader and you start sweeping in all kinds of lawful 
political activity.'' In response to terrorist attacks like the bombings 
of the World Trade Center in 1993, the Oklahoma City federal building 
in 1995 and the Olympic park in Atlanta in 1996, the agency has increased 
efforts to deter such incidents in a major prevention program. In 
such cases, the Justice Department, the FBI and other law enforcement 
agencies said they operate under domestic security guidelines that 
require investigators to find a ``reasonable indication'' that a group 
is planning to break the law before they can open an inquiry into 
an organization. Before the authorities can use such intrusive tactics 
as wiretapping or property searches, they must have specific evidence. 
Yet FBI agents throughout the country have quietly evaluated the threat 
posed by a variety of extremist groups through its links to local 
authorities and informal interviews with the leaders of some groups. 
Their conclusion is that most of these groups pose little real danger. 
Much more difficult to investigate are lone terrorists inflamed by 
the oratory of extremist ideology but who belong to no group, drifting 
along society's frayed margins, ``off the grid,'' as some agents describe 
it, without the usual ties to family, friends or work. The profile 
fits Eric Robert Rudolph, the fugitive wanted for bombings at the 
Atlanta Olympics, a gay nightclub and two abortion clinics. He has 
kept his beliefs mostly to himself, although acquaintances hint that 
he was familiar with religious extremism and hate groups. In contrast, 
James Charles Kopp, who is being sought as a material witness in the 
killing of Slepian, left a trail of clues about his motives. He was 
an early follower of Randall Terry, a leader of Operation Rescue. 
Later, Kopp was associated with the Lambs of Christ, an another militant 
anti-abortion group. One law-enforcement official said that the government 
should do what it does best. ``We should investigate violations,'' 
he said. ``We shouldn't investigate groups.''

Everyone who knew Dr. Barnett Slepian knew that the slight, graying 
physician endured a measure of stress that would exhaust, even break, 
most people. There were the strangers who pawed through the garbage 
cans at his home and growled ``murderer'' as they passed him in the 
grocery store aisle. Demonstrators assailed his pregnant patients 
as they arrived at his office for their checkups, calling him a baby 
killer. Outside the clinic where he performed abortions two days a 
week, pickets shouted epithets like ``pig'' to his face. Slepian, 
an obstetrician and gynecologist by training and an abortion doctor 
by principle, rarely acknowledged the strain. He might crack an occasional 
joke at the expense of the protesters who shadowed him at work and 
on weekends. Then he would do something unexpected, like invite an 
anti-abortion leader to breakfast or stop and chat with a familiar 
demonstrator outside the clinic. So when he was killed Oct. 23 by 
a sniper's bullet fired through the kitchen window of his home in 
the Buffalo, N.Y., suburbs, a furtive execution that fit a pattern 
of four earlier attacks on abortion providers in western New York 
state and Canada, friends and relatives wondered not so much that 
Slepian's work could arouse such murderous violence. He had predicted 
as much himself. Instead, they wondered, once again, that he persisted 
in that work, long after other Buffalo doctors had surrendered to 
the pressure of abortion opponents. ``He was an incredibly fatalistic 
person who thought that if your number's up, it's up, and there is 
nothing you can do about it,'' said H. Amanda Robb, the doctor's 32-year-old 
niece. ``And he was incredibly stubborn. He said that women had a 
right to comprehensive health care and since he was a women's doctor, 
he was going to provide it for them.'' Slepian is the third doctor 
to be killed in the last five years in bombings and shootings that 
have killed 7 people and wounded 17 at abortion clinics around the 
nation. To his tormentors, he was simply an abortion doctor. To members 
of the abortion rights movement, he was a martyr for their cause. 
But Slepian was far from either. In interviews with friends and family 
members, he emerges as more than a one-dimensional abstract _ a conservative 
who advocated old-fashioned values like self-reliance, a shy man who 
had rare flashes of anger, a doctor who performed abortions but had 
no more patience for women who had multiple abortions than for women 
who had multiple children they did not want or could not support. 
He was killed because he performed a medical procedure that has become 
emotional and politicized. Yet there is nothing in his life to suggest 
he was a crusader in either politics or medicine. Rather, he was an 
obstinate, unassuming man who did a remarkable thing. Out of contrariness 
and out of conscience, say those who knew him, he refused to allow 
anyone to dictate what kind of doctor he should be, and for that, 
he paid with his life. The clues to Slepian's flinty brand of commitment 
lie, in part, in his upbringing. His was a family that took success 
for granted even as it teetered on the edge of poverty. To earn money 
for medical school, he shoveled muck at a ranch and drove a taxi. 
He made few friends, but those he had were friends for life. When 
their wives were sick, he called repeatedly. When they were lonely, 
he flew to their side. Slepian, who was known as Bart, used to tell 
people that he chose obstetrics because it is a specialty that exposes 
a doctor to the least suffering, and that he performed abortions because 
it was legal and the alternatives were so much worse. Slepian often 
expressed exasperation over women who came to him for abortion after 
abortion. ``Don't they get it?'' his clinic staff recall him saying 
more than once. He had the same impatience for women like those he 
remembered from his residency in inner-city Buffalo, who had child 
after child and no means of support. ``He had the contempt for that 
of somebody who had pulled himself up by his bootstraps and made it 
in the world,'' Ms. Robb said. He believed that to ban abortions or, 
just as shameful in his view, to stop teaching young doctors how to 
perform them, would not correct the human imperfections that he found 
so irritating. ``There are 1.5 million abortions performed in this 
country,'' his niece said, ``and he just felt we're not equipped to 
handle 1.5 million unwanted children.'' When he was killed, at the 
age of 52, Bart Slepian owned an imposing red brick home in the quiet 
suburb of Amherst, complete with a swimming pool with piped-in music 
and an assortment of the time-saving gadgets he adored. Slepian's 
trajectory to that comfortable doctor's life had been unconventional. 
His grandfather, a Russian Jewish immigrant who started out selling 
shoelaces from a pushcart in Boston, propelled all five of his sons 
into Harvard at a time when few Jews met the university's blue-blood 
standards. His father, in turn, decreed that his own three sons would 
be doctors or earn Ph.D's. ``We grew up in a home where there was 
tremendous, tremendous, tremendous respect for education,'' said Serena 
Robb, Slepian's sister, who is four years older than him. ``If you 
got an A, it was OK If you got a B, you got yelled at.'' The family's 
means did not match its expectations. Slepian's father, Philip, had 
joined his own father's business manufacturing leather soles for shoes. 
Soon after Bart was born in 1946 in Boston, the company failed, so 
to save money, the father moved his family of six to his in-laws' 
apartment in McKeesport, Pa., and then to Rochester, N.Y. Once settled, 
Slepian's father set himself up as a freelance writer, crisscrossing 
the country in his old Studebaker, researching the origins of prominent 
citizens at the Library of Congress and writing their stories for 
small-town newspapers. He sold articles by the hundreds, and was still 
writing until his death nine years ago at the age of 93. The success 
that was expected of Bart Slepian did not come easily. As a child, 
he was so shy that he cried when anyone looked at him, his sister 
recalled. An unexceptional student, he went to a local community college 
before transferring to the University of Denver, where he majored 
in zoology. Rejected by medical schools in the United States _ the 
fate of two out of three applicants in the late 1960s _ he studied 
one year in Belgium and then enrolled at the Autonomous University 
for Medicine in Guadalajara, Mexico. His friends remember him as funny 
and obstinate, a thin young man with glasses and a receding hairline 
who beat all comers at arm-wrestling and pool. ``Bart had certain 
beliefs, strongly held,'' said Richard Schwarz, an old classmate who 
is an internist on Long Island. ``He always said you shouldn't sit 
around whining about things,'' Schwarz said. ``He would say, `Go after 
what's yours and what's right.''' Bart Slepian's determination surfaced 
in quirky ways. He once insisted on going to the top of the World 
Trade Center, despite a crippling fear of heights. To get to the window, 
he crawled, inch by inch. ``I said, `You don't have to do this,' '' 
recalled Schwarz, who was with him at the time. ``And he said, `I 
want to do it.' Bart made it count. He felt alive.'' Forced to drop 
out of school every few semesters to work, he lived in Reno with his 
sister Serena, a widow who was struggling to take care of two young 
daughters. She worked as a waitress and a blackjack dealer, sharing 
her tips with him while he drove a cab, cleaned barns at a ranch and 
worked as a laboratory assistant at the local Veterans Administration 
hospital. After graduation, he moved to Buffalo for his medical residency. 
There he married Lynne Breitbart, a registered nurse 10 years his 
junior, and scraped together the money to buy an obstetrics practice 
from a doctor who was about to retire. He had a soothing, unhurried 
manner. When a patient of his, Patti Durlak, was diagnosed with diabetes, 
Slepian referred her to a specialist but called every few days for 
months to help her overcome a fear of the needles she had to use for 
her insulin injections. ``The other doctor said, `Just deal with it,''' 
Mrs. Durlak recalled. ``Not Dr. Slepian.'' In most ways, he was a 
typical suburban family man, working six days a week and spending 
his free time at Little League games and county fairs with his four 
sons. But by the late 1980s, he and other abortion doctors in Buffalo 
were under siege. In one notorious 1991 incident recorded on videotape, 
the Rev. Paul Schenck, one of the fieriest of Buffalo's anti-abortion 
leaders, threw himself in front of the doctor's car as he pulled into 
the clinic driveway. Slepian parked on the street. As he pushed his 
way through the crowd of chanting demonstrators, Schenck cupped his 
hands around his mouth and lunged, shouting, ``Slepian, you pig!'' 
Slepian's attempts to separate the abortion conflict from his private 
life were futile. The protests followed him home and the man who had 
been so bashful as a boy found himself, uncomfortably, at the center 
of controversy and attention. Once, he showed his anger. In 1988, 
when demonstrators jeered at him from the sidewalk in front of his 
home as he opened Hanukkah presents with his children, the doctor 
came out brandishing a baseball bat. He denied he hurt anyone, but 
a town judge ordered him to repair one protester's smashed van window 
and pay a portion of another's medical bills. The outburst surprised 
his family and friends. It was not Slepian's style to make a public 
fuss, much less acknowledge the stress of being taunted by protesters. 
``Stress?'' his oldest brother Paul responded gruffly when asked about 
the doctor's mood. ``I never heard the word used in my family, except 
as an engineering term. He said it was a nuisance.'' Mrs. Slepian 
did not respond to requests for an interview. She expressed rage to 
The Buffalo News shortly after the shooting. She said that whoever 
had killed her husband deserved the death penalty and that she would 
be happy to administer the lethal injection herself. She also spoke 
out after Schenck's brother, Robert, another anti-abortion leader 
who frequently confronted Slepian, sent a bouquet of flowers. Mrs. 
Slepian denounced him as ``a hypocrite.'' After the confrontation 
in 1988, Slepian turned to civil harassment lawsuits, letters and 
levity to deal with the protesters. In 1993, when a man active in 
the anti-abortion effort was arrested for rifling through the doctor's 
garbage cans at home, Slepian tried to treat the incident lightly. 
``They hopefully got the bags full of dirty diapers,'' he joked. He 
tried to engage his critics through the local newspaper. He told The 
Buffalo News that abortion protesters should turn their energies to 
helping women avoid unwanted pregnancies through birth control and 
counseling. In a letter to the editor he warned that by repeatedly 
calling him a murderer, his critics were inciting violence. Slepian 
accepted that opponents of abortion acted out of moral conviction, 
his friends said, but resented the personal attacks. ``He thought 
it tended to demonize and dehumanize him and increased the danger,'' 
said his lawyer, Glenn Edward Murray. So Slepian took a step that 
few of the nation's beleaguered abortion clinic doctors dared. He 
insisted that if he tried hard enough, he might cut through the venom. 
To the dismay of the staff members who feared for his safety, Slepian 
began about a year ago to stop and chat with protesters he recognized 
outside the Womenservices abortion clinic in Buffalo, where he worked 
two days a week. He surprised a gathering of protesters who were preparing 
for what they euphemistically called a ``house call,'' or demonstration 
at the doctor's home, and invited the protest's organizer, the Rev. 
Robert Behn, to breakfast. Their hourlong conversation the next morning 
was inconclusive, Behn said, dismissing Slepian's gesture as an ``attempt 
to get people to like him.'' He asked Slepian how performing abortions 
affected him spiritually. In response, he recalled, the doctor said, 
``I'm fine spiritually.'' Slepian, meanwhile, focused more on time 
away from home with his family. He planned to take a cruise next spring. 
He bought a time-share apartment near Disney World in Florida. ``He 
had so many plans,'' said Ellen Fink, a close friend of the couple 
for 15 years. ``He wasn't done. He wasn't done living yet.'' Still, 
sometimes during the most casual conversations, a shadow would appear. 
When his wife gave him a gray African parrot for a birthday gift, 
Slepian joked that the bird would probably outlive him so he would 
teach it his eulogy. ``He would talk about the funeral he wanted,'' 
Mrs. Fink said. ``He said he didn't have a lot of friends and wanted 
all of them to come in separate cars, one in each car, so he'd have 
a long procession.'' In the week before his death, Slepian had reasons 
to be preoccupied with thoughts of mortality. A medical checkup had 
revealed a blockage of his heart, Mrs. Fink said, recounting a conversation 
with Mrs. Slepian the day of the slaying. A blockage is a sign of 
probable coronary artery disease. He was to have more tests the following 
week. ``I said, `Lynne, just relax, it's going to be OK,''' Mrs. Fink 
recalled. That same day, the National Abortion Federation sent a fax 
to the Womenservices clinic warning of a pattern of sniper attacks 
on abortion doctors that occurred in early November. Marilynne Buckham, 
the clinic director, sent it to Slepian. ``He definitely took it seriously,'' 
she recalled. Typically, the doctor did not share any concerns he 
might have felt. ``It was a normal day,'' said Tammi Latini, his office 
assistant. ``We were horsing around.' That evening, the Slepians went 
to synagogue to mark the ninth anniversary of the death of Slepian's 
father. Shortly after they returned home, a sniper's bullet smashed 
through the kitchen window, killing Slepian as he chatted with his 
wife and sons. The protesters returned to the clinic five days later, 
the first day it reopened. Mrs. Buckham, the director, said Slepian 
would not have been surprised. They have their routine. So did he. 
``He never wanted a day to end on a bad note,'' she said. ``At the 
end of the day, I would always say, `Thank you for coming.' And he 
would always turn with a stupid grin and say, `Thanks for having me.'''
