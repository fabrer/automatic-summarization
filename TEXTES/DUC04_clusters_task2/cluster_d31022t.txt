A fire turned a Swedish dance hall jammed with teen-age Halloween 
revelers into a deathtrap, killing at least 60 people and injuring 
about 180. ``It reminded me of the gas chambers at Auschwitz,'' local 
rescue service leader Lennart Olin said on national radio, describing 
the sight when rescuers first entered the building in Goteborg, a 
city of half a million people on the country's west coast. The fire 
was the deadliest in modern Swedish history since 1978, when 20 people 
died in the town of Boraas. ``We are still searching the building 
... but so far we have found 60 dead,'' Goteborg police official Jan 
Edmundson said on national radio. At a news conference Friday morning, 
police said most victims choked to death on smoke and poisonous gases. 
The injured toll was lowered slightly to 180, but included seven people 
who needed treatment at emergency burn centers. Binan Atta was walking 
to the Macedonian Association when he saw the fire. He said he raced 
in and pulled to safety several people, including a friend. ``His 
clothes had burned off. His skin was red and bubbly,'' Atta said. 
``Lots of kids were just screaming,'' he added at Hammarkullen Lutheran 
Church, where several dozen family and friends of victims gathered. 
``I saw about 10 people in windows who just jumped. They didn't even 
look down'' beforehand. Fire officials were alerted at 11:43 p.m. 
(2243 GMT) Thursday and had a fire truck at the scene four minutes 
later, rescue workers said. The blaze was already consuming the two-story 
brick building. The dance was on the second floor. About 300 or 400 
people were inside, police said. Many escaped on their own. Police 
rescued 40, and recovered 59 bodies. The 60th victim died at a hospital. 
``It was a panic,'' Goteborg police spokesman Bengt Staaf said, with 
youths trampling each other to get out, and other youths scuffling 
with police to get in and attempt to help friends. The cause of the 
fire was not immediately known. ``What we know is that there was an 
explosion,'' Edmundson said. Olin said there were signs that the fire 
was set. ``The fact that it spread so fast indicates that it was not 
a normal fire,'' he said. The Swedish news agency TT reported 190 
people were taken to hospitals with injuries, and about 20 were in 
intensive care. Seven of the most severely injured were taken by helicopter 
to burn clinics in other cities, the report said. Goteborg is about 
500 kilometers (300 miles) southwest of the capital, Stockholm. The 
fire broke out about midnight (2300 GMT Thursday) in building of the 
local Macedonian Association, which organized the dance. The crowd 
in the second story of the building contained mostly 13 to 18 year 
olds celebrating Halloween and a holiday weekend. ``A night full of 
expectation, happiness over extra leave from school and high spirits 
in anticipation of a weekend was brutally and suddenly changed into 
a tragedy of incomprehensible dimensions,'' the Goteborg city council 
said in a statement. ``Goteborg is today a city in shock.'' Jamal 
Fawz, 15, told TT that he was out on the dance floor when the blaze 
started with about 400 people inside. ``It looked like it started 
in the ceiling, and lamps and loudspeakers fell to the floor,'' he 
was quoted as saying. ``It was chaos. Everybody was trying to get 
out and people trampled on each other on the way to the exit. ... 
Others kicked out the windows and jumped out.'' Ambulances were called 
in from several nearby communities. The Goteborg rescue services also 
brought city buses into service to help transport the injured. Olin 
said the rescue service inspected the building in April 1997 and ``fulfilled 
all possible demands as far as emergency exits and the possibility 
for fast evacuation.'' Anna-Lisa Saar, a social worker at Oestra Hospital, 
where many of the victims were taken, said identifying many of them 
was difficult. ``Maybe you have teen-agers yourself and know how they 
are ... They maybe don't have their own identification, but have that 
of a friend who is a year older. Girls don't carry their identification 
on them, but in a bag and maybe that wasn't lying with the body,'' 
she said, according to TT. Goteborg has about 435,000 people.

A fire turned a dance hall jammed with teen-age Halloween revelers 
into a deathtrap, killing at least 60 people and injuring about 180 
in Sweden's second-largest city. The fast-spreading fire completely 
gutted the building and left rescuers facing a hideous scene that 
local rescue service leader Lennart Olin likened to a ``gas chamber.'' 
Although an estimated 400 people, most aged 13 to 18, were at the 
dance on the building's second floor, the facility had approval for 
a maximum capacity of 150, said Hans Carlsson, the detective leading 
the disaster investigation. The fire, at the facilities of the Macedonian 
Association local immigrant group, was the deadliest in modern Swedish 
history. In 1978, 20 people died in a fire at a hotel in the town 
of Boraas. At a news conference Friday morning, police said most victims 
choked to death on smoke and poisonous gases; 59 bodies were found 
at the scene and the 60th victim died at a hospital, officials said. 
The dance apparently was attended mostly by immigrants or children 
of immigrant. Police said the list of injured included Somalis and 
people from current and former Yugoslavia. The Macedonian Association, 
which rents space in the building, had in turn rented the facility 
out to another person for the dance, Carlsson said. That person was 
not immdiately identified. Binan Atta was walking to the Macedonian 
Association when he saw the fire. He said he raced in and pulled to 
safety several people, including a friend. ``His clothes had burned 
off. His skin was red and bubbly,'' Atta said. ``Lots of kids were

said. The blaze was already consuming the building. The building had 
just two exits, one of which was blocked by fire, city police technician 
Stephen Holmberg was quoted as saying by the Swedish news agency TT.

A fire turned a dance hall jammed with teen-age Halloween revelers 
into a deathtrap, killing 65 people and injuring 157 others in Sweden's 
second-largest city. The fast-spreading fire that broke out just a 
few minutes before midnight Thursday gutted the building and left

A fire turned a dance hall jammed with teen-age Halloween revelers

Hundreds of teen-agers jammed into an upstairs hall planning to dance 
the night away, but by the time the sun rose Friday they were dead, 
clinging to life in hospitals or weeping in disbelief at a fire that 
killed 67 of them. Police said another 173 people were injured, 20 
of them severely, in the explosive fire that engulfed the plain brick 
two-story building just before midnight Thursday and turned a boisterous 
disco dance into a screaming terror in a matter of moments. Bent metal 
bars on some of the hall's windows showed the panic-fueled strength 
that the teen-agers, many of them immigrants, exerted as they sought 
ways out of the hall, which with some 400 people inside was crowded 
to more than twice its legal capacity. Below the second-floor windows 
lay stray shoes, broken glass and bloody blankets used to wrap those 
who may or may not have lived. ``I've been crying all day. I haven't 
been able to sleep. I'm alive, so why should I sleep when my friends 
are dead,'' 17-year-old Alina Turk said as she stood outside the ruined 
building Friday afternoon. She said she had been at the dance and 
two male friends of hers died. Zuhir Hersi, the 17-year-old disc jockey 
at the bash, told of his ordeal in telegraphic bursts. ``Panic. No 
help. No police. No firemen. Only kids helping each other,'' he said 
from his bed in a Goteborg hospital. Although Hersi, like many of 
the youths at the dance, believes the police and firemen were slow, 
authorities said the first fire trucks were on the scene within five 
minutes of getting the alarm. But the fire spread so fast that even 
an instant response would likely have been too slow. The cause of 
the fire had not been determined as of Friday evening. Fire Brigade 
Engineer Bo Wahlstroem said the flames' quick, raging spread could 
indicate arson, or that the fire had burned undetected for a time 
before exploding. The fire destroyed the building, whose second floor, 
where the dance took place, was rented by the local Macedonian immigrant 
association in Sweden's second-largest city. The association had hired 
out the hall for the night to eight party arrangers, police said but 
declined to identify the arrangers. The crowd was mostly aged 13 to 
18, witnesses said, and consisted mostly of immigrants or children 
of immigrant parents. Officials said the dead and injured were of 
19 nationalities, including Somalis, Ethiopians, Iraqis, Iranians 
and Swedes, as well as people from the current and former Yugoslavia 
and unspecified Latin American countries. Identifying the dead was 
a wrackingly slow process, forcing relatives and friends exhausted 
with dread to wait for hours at hospitals. Some were able to make 
the wait in rooms off-limits to journalists, but many had to wait 
in corridors, crying and teen-agers hurry in and out of rooms as they 
looked for their pals. Only 14 bodies had been indentified by Friday 
evening. ``The identification is hard not only because of the burns 
but also because they have no driver's licenses or other documents 
_ they were so young,'' said Kerstin Einarsson of Sahlgrenska Hospital, 
the largest in the city of 435,000 some 500 kilometers (300 miles) 
west of Stockholm. The blaze, the worst fire disaster in Sweden's 
modern history, shocked a country renowned for its smooth calmness. 
King Carl XVI Gustaf, on a trip out of the country, sent a statement 
reassuring victims' relatives that ``all of us in Sweden feel great 
sympathy.'' Prime Minister Goeran Persson travelled from Stockholm 
to the fire site, first laying flowers outside and walking into the 
gutted wreck. ``The floor was full of shoes and boots, the same kind 
of boots my own children wear,'' he said. On Friday evening, about 
1,500 mostly young people, came to the Goteborg Cathedral to try to 
assuage their grief and bewilderment at a memorial service. The youths 
were dressed in the same sort of hip-hop garb that the dance-goers 
had worn, but listened to delicate hymns instead of pounding disco. 
They wept, they embraced, and some looked around nervously, apparently 
not knowing how to behave in a church. ``I don't go to church. I'm 
a Muslim, but I don't go to prayers,'' said a young man who gave his 
name only as Sami. ``I'm accompanying my Christian friends. We lost 
someone. We're mourning _ that's all.''

A panicky telephone call in poor Swedish was the first word that authorities 
got of a fire racing through a dance hall crowded with immigrant teen-agers, 
delaying fire squads' response to the blaze that killed 60 and injured 
162, officials said Saturday. Per-Olof Ortarsen of Goteborg's emergency 
services line said the call was so hard to understand that it took 
three minutes for workers to figure out what was going on and where 
to send fire trucks. The first fire trucks and rescue squads were 
on the scene six minutes after the call was received, Ortarsen said 
at a news conference. He and other officials declined to comment on 
whether a quicker response could have saved any of the mostly immigrant 
victims. The minutes of delay felt endless to those caught in the 
terror of the fire and survivors have spoken angrily of what they 
saw as a slow and even obstructive response. ''No help. No police. 
No firemen,'' 17-year-old Zuhir Hersi, one of the disc jockeys at 
the bash, said Friday, hours after the blaze exploded. ''Just kids 
helping kids.'' And once the squads arrived, the kids were blocked 
from helping, they say. ''We could have saved more young people if 
only police hadn't stopped us,'' Mohanned Hussein was quoted as saying 
by the newspaper Expressen. On Saturday, hundreds of people stood 
quietly outside the gutted building amid flowers and candles as they 
attempted to come to grips with catastrophe. In the parking lot that 
a day before had been a tumult of ambulances and screams, mourners 
had laid a 30-meter-long (100-foot-long) pile of bouquets, candles 
and cards of remembrance. The cards' inscriptions were brief _ ``I 
will see you in heaven,'' ``We miss you'' _ and the people who stood 
reading them also had few words. ``I just wanted to show my sympathy. 
I think about them. There's nothing else we can do,'' said Caroline 
Ericsson, who didn't know any of the victims. For Lasse Gustavsson, 
having the right words wasn't as important as showing his face, severely 
disfigured in a fire. The former Goteborg firefighter lost his ears, 
his eyelids and most of his nose in a gas explosion. By showing up, 
he said, he wanted to show the victims' relatives and friends that 
spirit can help them pull through despair. ``I can't give them hope. 
Consolation is enough,'' he said, as people nearby cast uneasy glances 
at his scars. Many of those injured in the blaze may have to endure 
similar shocked looks the rest of their lives. Authorities say the 
explosive fire quickly raised the temperature in the overcrowded hall 
to 600 degrees (1,100 F). The cause of the fire that broke out just 
before midnight Thursday remains under investigation. Witness accounts 
have varied widely, with some reporting smoke coming from the cellar 
and others saying the fire appeared to start in the ceiling of the 
dance hall on the building's second floor. The fire's quick spread 
has prompted speculation that it could have been set, but officials 
also say the explosive spread could have been because the fire had 
been burning undetected for some time. What's known is that the hall 
was packed far beyond its capacity. Licensed to hold a maximum of 
150, the hall held at least 250 and perhaps as many as 400 when the 
fire hit. The crowd was mostly teen-agers and mostly immigrants or 
children of immigrant parents. They had come for a dance organized 
by eight party-arrangers whom police have not identified; the hall 
was rented by the organizers from the local Macedonian immigrant association. 
Officials said the dead and injured were of 19 nationalities, including 
Somalis, Ethiopians, Iraqis, Iranians and Swedes, as well as people 
from the current and former Yugoslavia and unspecified Latin American 
countries. Identifying the dead was a wrackingly slow process, forcing 
relatives and friends already exhausted with dread to wait for hours 
at hospitals. Only 18 of the dead had been identified by midday Saturday. 
``The identification is hard because they have no driver's licenses 
or other documents _ they were so young,'' said Kerstin Einarsson 
of Sahlgrenska Hospital, the largest in the city of 435,000 residents 
about 300 miles (500 kilometers) west of Stockholm. The worst previous 
Swedish fire disaster in modern history was in 1978 in Boraas, when 
20 people died in a hotel fire.

Forensic experts examining heavily burned bodies were able Saturday 
to identify more of the 60 young people who died in a dance hall fire, 
but the catastrophe's most tormenting question was still unanswered. 
How could it happen; what caused the flames that raced through a hall 
packed far beyond capacity, blocking one of the exits and forcing 
panicked teen-agers to flee down the one remaining staircase and leap 
out of second-story windows? ''As long as the technicians haven't 
established the cause of the fire, we don't know if it's arson or 
not,'' Goteborg chief prosecutor Ulf Noren said Saturday evening. 
Earlier in the day, Noren had said it was a ''50-50'' chance that 
the fire was arson, prompting wide speculation that authorities had 
tracked down new clues. But Noren later retracted the remark, saying 
he'd meant only that no possibilities were being excluded. As investigators 
worked to find the cause, examiners identified another 22 of the bodies, 
bringing the total to 40, and officials said 49 people were released 
from hospital. Of the 162 people who suffered non-fatal injuries in 
the Thursday night fire, 76 remain hospitalized. Most of the victims 
were immigrants or of immigrant parentage, from countries including 
Iraq, Iran, Somalia, Ethiopia and current and former Yugoslavia. The 
first call alerting authorities to the fire was made in heavily accented 
Swedish and that, combined with noise and the caller's distress, delayed 
the fire squads' response by several minutes. Per-Olof Ortarsen of 
Goteborg's emergency services line said the call was so hard to understand 
that it took three minutes for workers to figure out what was going 
on and where to send fire trucks. The first fire trucks and rescue 
squads were on the scene six minutes after the call was received, 
Ortarsen told a news conference. He and other officials declined to 
comment on whether a quicker response could have saved any of the 
mostly immigrant victims. But the minutes of delay felt endless to 
those caught in the terror of the fire and survivors have spoken angrily 
of what they saw as a slow and even obstructive response. ``No help. 
No police. No firemen,'' 17-year-old Zuhir Hersi, one of the disc 
jockeys at the bash said Friday, hours after the blaze exploded. ``Just 
kids helping kids.'' And once the squads arrived, the kids were then 
blocked from helping, they say. ``We could have saved more young people 
if only police hadn't stopped us,'' Mohanned Hussein was quoted as 
saying by the newspaper Expressen. On Saturday, hundreds of people 
stood quietly outside the gutted building amid flowers and candles 
as they attempted to come to grips with catastrophe. In the parking 
lot that a day before had been a tumult of ambulances and screams, 
mourners had laid a 30-meter-long (100-foot-long) pile of bouquets, 
candles and cards of remembrance. The cards' inscriptions were brief 
_ ``I will see you in heaven,'' ``We miss you'' _ and the people who 
stood reading them also had few words. ``I just wanted to show my 
sympathy. I think about them. There's nothing else we can do,'' said 
Caroline Ericsson, who didn't know any of the fire's victims. ''It's 
damn difficult,'' said Connie Mesfin, who said she lost a friend in 
the blaze. Lasse Gustafsson, a former Goteborg firefighter severely 
disfigured in an explosion, also came to the club site to try to show 
the victims' relatives and friends that spirit can help them pull 
through despair. ``I can't give them hope. Consolation is enough,'' 
he said, as people nearby cast uneasy glances at his scars. Many of 
those injured in the blaze may have to endure similar shocked looks 
the rest of their lives. Authorities say the explosive fire quickly 
raised the temperature in the hall to 600 degrees (1,100 F). The hall 
was packed far beyond its capacity. Licensed to hold a maximum of 
150, the hall held at least 250 and perhaps as many as 400 when the 
fire hit. One of the two exit stairways was blocked by fire and there 
were conflicting statements from witnesses as to whether the fire 
came up the stairs from a lower level, or whether it spread there 
after breaking out in the second-floor rooms. The worst previous fire 
disaster in modern Sweden was in 1978 in Boraas, when 20 people died 
in a hotel fire. Goteborg, Sweden's second-largest city with about 
435,000 people, is 500 kilometers (300 miles) southwest of Stockholm.
