A strong sign that this city is going bonkers for the Padres came 
Friday morning when 680 fans agreed to shave their heads for a radio 
promotion raffle in return for a 1-in-680 chance at skybox tickets 
for post-season play. ``This was more a show of support for the team 
than it was for the one ticket,'' said Tommy Sablan, producer of the 
``Jeff and Jer'' show. ``It was symbolic of the efforts of the bald 
Padres _ Tony Gwynn, Wally Joyner, Greg Vaughn, Jim Leyritz. About 
a thousand people showed up _ men, women and children. We had 10 barbers 
and 20 hairdressers and it took six hours for the lines to either 
get buzzed or straight-razored. ``We were shocked at the turnout. 
But this is a bandwagon town. `Buy the ticket on the day of the concert' 
type public. You'll see an even bigger bandwagon on Monday when they've 
won and then hopefully we play the Yankees and it's a real World Series.'' 
After the Padres beat the Braves, 3-0, in Game 2 of the National League 
Championship Series on Thursday night in Atlanta to take a two-game 
lead in the four-of-seven-game series, San Diego fans began gearing 
up for a shot at the World Series in more traditional ways. It would 
be the team's first World Series appearance since 1984, and in the 
downtown business district Friday, marquees and banners read ``Go 
Padres'' and a lunch-hour rally was attended by several hundred fans. 
The Padres set an attendance record of 2,555,901 this season, up a 
half-million from last year and nearly a million and a half from three 
years ago. It stemmed in part from an effort by John Moores, the Padres 
owner, and Larry Lucchino, the team's president, to put family entertainment 
in the park after they bought the team in December 1994. ``This is 
a more diversified group of fans than I saw in Atlanta,'' Lucchino 
said. ``Their crowd seemed yuppified. We're proud of our three generations 
of families who come to the games.'' Donna McMahon, a 63-year-old 
homemaker from La Jolla, has been a fan since she was 10 and the Pacific 
Coast League Padres played at Lane Field near the harbor. She would 
take a streetcar after school to meet her father, and he would buy 
bleacher seats. Later, she brought her four children to Jack Murphy 
Stadium for the National League Padres when 2,500 people was a crowd. 
Now, she brings her grandchildren to a sold-out Qualcomm Stadium. 
``There are different groups in the stands,'' she said, ``the upper 
class, the middle class, the business person, the beer-drinking fan, 
the children, all of the Mexican fans from across the border. We are 
true fans _ all of us.'' San Diego Mayor Susan Golding agrees, while 
also giving credit to the balmy weather. ``Padre fans are a cross-section 
from all over the county,'' she said. ``Downtown, suburban, rural, 
east, north, ranchers and farmers to high-tech engineers, yuppies 
to the new kids _ the X generation. A lot from across the border. 
The Padres are extremely popular in Tijuana. We do have the perfect 
weather for a long baseball season. Playing in the World Series in 
October has got to be better than in New York.'' Carlos Carrion, who 
was born in San Diego and has been a baseball fan for 25 years, brings 
his 10- and 8-year-old sons to the stadium. ``This is a great chance 
to let my children see the players work,'' Carrion said. ``They can 
look up to these guys and understand their character and their work 
ethic.'' The Padres ticket office estimates that on average, more 
than 15,000 fans in the 65,000-seat stadium are Latin Americans from 
San Diego, Baja California or the state of Sonora. The Padres have 
the first major league baseball souvenir store in Tijuana.

The moment of truth for Chuck Knoblauch came in the bottom of the 
first inning when his name was announced at Yankee Stadium for the 
first time since he neglected to chase down that memorable loose ball 
last Wednesday. There were no boos. It was a very warm ovation. They 
liked him. They really liked him. Knoblauch exhaled. Knoblauch had 
emphasized before the game that he was concerned about winning and 
rumbling into the World Series, not about the fans. But it surely 
made Knoblauch feel at home when he realized that the fans had forgiven 
him. Victories, more than time, had healed the malice toward Knoblauch 
and he could play second base without earplugs. When the Yankees defeated 
the Indians, 9-5, in Game 6 on Tuesday night to advance to their second 
World Series in three years, Knoblauch was easily the most relieved 
player on the field. The awful mistake that he had made in Game 2 
would be forgotten. The Yankees had won the pennant, and Knoblauch 
was celebrating as much as anyone. ``To have them act like that toward 
me was tremendous,'' said Knoblauch, about the response that he received. 
``It was a great feeling, and it really helped me out.'' Knoblauch 
was wearing a cap that declared the Yankees champions of the American 
League in 1998; Champagne dripped off the brim as he spoke. He did 
not look up, but continued to talk about how he had learned a lot 
by being vilified after making a mistake that Little Leaguers are 
expected not to make. ``Just to face things and take it like a man 
and answer all the questions, although they're tough,'' Knoblauch 
said. ``You see what you're made of when you have to bounce back from 
something like that. That's basically what I learned.'' If the Yankees 
had lost the ALCS, even some of Knoblauch's teammates had said that 
he would be branded as the villain for failing to pursue the ball 
that glanced off Travis Fryman's back while he was running outside 
the baseline. Knoblauch had argued with the umpire while the go ahead 
run scored from first and the Indians won, 4-1. Now Knoblauch can 
watch television and read the newspapers again without getting queasy. 
``That's huge for him,'' David Cone said. ``That's huge for me. I 
let them back into the game, and that would have been a tough one 
if they would have come back and beat us. And Knobbie, I'm sure he's 
feeling a lot better now.'' Knoblauch, who had two hits in five at-bats, 
was working on his second bottle of Champagne five minutes after reporters 
were allowed into the clubhouse. He flashed the sort of smile that 
he had not shown too much recently and, now that the Yankees are in 
the World Series, Knoblauch should expect to be teased often about 
his mistake. ``Maybe if we go all the way, we'll do that,'' Derek 
Jeter said. ``I don't know what I'll say, but I'll think of something 
good.''

Hours after Darryl Strawberry was released from Columbia Presbyterian 
Medical Center Friday, he spoke happily about being able to play with 
his two young children, joked about eating a small amount of chicken 
and potatoes and sounded relieved to be at home in Fort Lee, N.J., 
instead of in a hospital. ``I'm really feeling good,'' said Strawberry, 
in a telephone interview. ``It's nice to be home with the kids and 
to just kick back. That's all that I'm going to do. This feels good.'' 
Strawberry, who underwent surgery to remove a cancer from his colon 
on Oct. 3, said he will remain in New Jersey for another 10 or 12 
days before returning home to Rancho Mirage, Calif. The 36-year old 
outfielder, who lost a significant amount of weight from his 215-pound 
frame, said he does not have enough strength to attend any of the 
World Series games and is content watching his teammates play the 
Padres on television. ``My heart is with them,'' said Strawberry, 
who spoke to several Yankees after they won the American League championship. 
``I'm just going to relax at home and watch the game. I'm looking 
forward to it. I may not be there, but it'll feel like I am.'' Paul 
O'Neill echoed the sentiments of many Yankees by saying, ``Everything 
we're going through is game. This is his life. Any time we get some 
good news about Darryl it's uplifting. We're all praying for him.'' 
Since cancerous cells were found in one of the 36 lymph nodes removed 
from his abdomen during the operation, Strawberry said doctors told 
him he will need six months of chemotherapy treatment once he returns 
to California. The 36-year-old outfielder said doctors told him he 
will need one treatment of at least one hour a week. ``I was never 
scared,'' said Strawberry. ``I was more emotional than anything. At 
the time of it, I had played for a while with this. I wanted to keep 
playing because I knew we were going to get into the World Series.'' 
At that point, Strawberry stopped and laughed, probably because the 
Yankees had made it to the World Series as he expected. ``I wanted 
to be there because that's what you play for,'' said Strawberry. ``I 
don't think that I was ever scared. It's something that I wanted to 
deal with head on. I talked to Eric Davis about the chemo. He said 
it's not as bad as some people say.'' Although the discovery of cancer 
in one lymph node proved that the cancer had spread, Strawberry remained 
optimistic about his future and said, ``It didn't worry me. I got 
all the information from the doctors. One out of 36 is good. It wasn't 
spreading. It didn't run off and get crazy like cancer can.'' When 
Strawberry was released from the hospital in a wheelchair Friday, 
a few hundred fans who had congregated chanted, ``Darryl, Darryl.'' 
Strawberry, who struggled not to cry, hugged a few nurses, thanked 
everyone for supporting him, then rose from the wheelchair and carefully 
entered a car. ``Wow, I never thought this day would come,'' Strawberry 
said. ``But it has.'' Unlike David Wells, Saturday night's starter 
in the World Series who predicted the Yankees would throttle the Padres 
in five games, Strawberry refused to make a prediction about whether 
he will soon be getting his third World Series ring. But Strawberry, 
who is still hopeful about returning to play in 1999, sounded very 
confident in the 1998 Yankees, who are wearing his number 39 on the 
back of their caps as inspiration. ``They look really good,'' said 
Strawberry.'' It's not going to be easy, but I think they're ready. 
The best thing about making it to the World Series is you know you 
don't have to go anywhere else after that. You've made it to that 
point and then you go do the best you can do. That's what it's all 
about.'' 
 NYT19981017.0014 
The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Oct. 17: It is 
fitting that this most memorable of baseball seasons should conclude 
with a World Series that opens Saturday night in Yankee Stadium, the 
aging but still grand cathedral of the sport. Bedecked in bunting 
and banners, the revered ballpark always elevates the game with its 
aura of history and accomplishment. That makes it the perfect venue 
for part of a championship series that will determine whether the 
1998 Yankees are one of the greatest teams of the modern era, or just 
a talented squad that owned the regular season but folded in the World 
Series. New Yorkers are a boisterous, boastful bunch, and the patter 
of the city this week has been loud and arrogant, or so it must seem 
to anyone venturing here from San Diego to root for the Padres. The 
word on the sidewalks and in the subways is that the Padres don't 
measure up against the Yankees. Sure, they have lethal starting pitchers 
in Kevin Brown and Andy Ashby, and one of the game's best closers 
in Trevor Hoffman, not to mention prolific hitters like Tony Gwynn 
and Greg Vaughn, who is hobbling but still dangerous. But how is that 
a match for the Yankees' World Series starting rotation of David Wells, 
Orlando Hernandez, David Cone and Andy Pettitte, bullpen flamethrower 
Mariano Rivera, plus the deepest batting order in baseball? Yet the 
truth is that Yankees fans are terrified the team will crumple. Baseball 
fans, even Yankee fans, can spend a lifetime waiting to see a home 
team of historic caliber, and this Yankee team will not reach that 
sanctified status unless it ends its record-setting season by winning 
the World Series. The doubts keep creeping up. The team was pitiful 
at the plate through most of the playoffs. Tino Martinez, the top 
run producer, has been in a numbing slump. Bernie Williams, the American 
League batting champ, hit well in the pennant series against the Cleveland 
Indians, but has seemed distracted by personal matters. Shane Spencer, 
the rookie slugging sensation of September, hasn't turned out to be 
the new Mr. October. Pettitte has been struggling since August. The 
curious thing about this team, which won more games during the regular 
season than any team in American League history, is how quiet and 
unobtrusive it can be. It sports no dominant superstar, no swaggering 
clubhouse leader, no one who seems to belong in New York. So when 
the Yankees start to drift on the field, fans tend to fear the team 
might simply fade away. Until the Indians surged temporarily ahead 
in the playoffs, the Yankees had faced no serious test of resiliency 
all season. New Yorkers can already taste that ticker-tape parade 
up Broadway. But behind every mighty cheer at the stadium Saturday 
night will lurk the fear that when the curtain falls on the season, 
an unheralded and unlegendary team from San Diego will be the one 
that is remembered. 
 NYT19981017.0027 
YANKEES Pitching The starting pitching enabled the Yankees to advance 
past Cleveland in the American League Championship Series. David Wells 
is 7-1 in his career in the postseason and he should have an additional 
edge against a Padres' lineup that is generally less effective against 
left-handed pitching. Orlando Hernandez has four terrific pitches, 
pitched seven shutout innings in the pivotal Game 4 of the ALCS and 
earned the start in Game 2 of this series. David Cone should benefit 
from six days' worth of rest when he starts Game 3, as well as being 
able to pitch in warm Southern California. Mariano Rivera's stuff 
might be as good as it has been all year, and Mike Stanton continues 
to be a dominant postseason pitcher. Reasons for concern: the erratic 
Andy Pettitte, who needs a home-plate umpire to call strikes on pitches 
low and away, and Jeff Nelson, who lost his command in his last brief 
outing. Offense There were signs in the ALCS that the offense is coming 
out of its collective slump _ Chuck Knoblauch is getting on base consistently, 
Derek Jeter is back to driving the ball to right field and through 
the middle, Bernie Williams had three hits in Game 6, and Scott Brosius 
has been a consistent force at the bottom of the lineup. But the Yankees 
do have holes: Chili Davis will be hard-pressed to catch up to the 
fastballs of Kevin Brown and Andy Ashby, and Tino Martinez's postseason 
funk is a problem. The Yankees could use a contribution from Jorge 
Posada, who will start in Games 1 and 2 and may get a chance to drive 
pitches low in the strike zone, where he can hit with power. Defense 
The Yankees have the best defense in baseball, excellent up the middle 
with Jeter and Knoblauch, and at third with Brosius. Nobody's really 
taken advantage of the fact that Williams has a poor arm in center 
field, but rest assured that Ken Caminiti, Steve Finley and Greg Vaughn 
will try. The Indians did expose the fact that the Yankees' pitchers 
have trouble preventing baserunners from stealing from second to third 
base. Baserunning The Yankees run well as they take extra bases, particularly 
Paul O'Neill, Brosius, Jeter and Knoblauch going first-to-third; Williams 
can make mistakes. The Yankees probably won't be able to steal against 
Kevin Brown, who has an effective slide step, but they could be aggressive 
against Andy Ashby, or the combination of Sterling Hitchcock and Jim 
Leyritz. PADRES Hitting Except for Jim Leyritz, no one in the San 
Diego lineup is particularly hot or particularly frightening at the 
moment. Tony Gwynn hasn't been as consistent as he usually is, Ken 
Caminiti and Greg Vaughn have been streaky. But the Padres are a veteran 
team capable of putting the ball in play, getting runners on base 
and then moving them along, and so long as they are getting exceptional 
pitching, that's all they really need. Quilvio Veras, the leadoff 
hitter, is adept at drawing walks and Steve Finley, who has become 
more pull conscious in the last two years, could try to take aim at 
the right field stands in Yankee Stadium. Vaughn's power could be 
a factor if the Yankees' pitchers don't jam him enough to keep him 
from leaning over the plate. Pitching Kevin Brown is the best pitcher 
in this series, capable of winning three games if necessary, should 
Padres manager Bruce Bochy choose to start him in Games 1, 4 and 7. 
But at some point, San Diego will need a big outing from either Andy 
Ashby or Sterling Hitchcock. When Ashby's right, he's hitting the 
corners with his sinking fastball and his slider, and when his command 
is suspect, he gets pounded. Hitchcock used his split-fingered fastball 
to great effectiveness against right-handed batters in the first two 
rounds of the playoffs, but the Yankees' left-handed hitters may cause 
him some concern. San Diego's middle relief is the weakest aspect 
of the team, with Randy Myers and Mark Langston from the left side 
(the stuff of each has waned). But if a lead can be delivered into 
the hands of closer Trevor Hoffman, he'll keep it. Defense They mostly 
catch the ball and avoid mistakes, though they are unspectacular. 
Shortstop Chris Gomez and the second baseman Veras are adept at turning 
double plays, and Caminiti won a Gold Glove at third base last year; 
Wally Joyner has good hands at first; the center fielder Steve Finley 
is extremely quick in tracking down base hits and returning the ball 
to the infield. Tony Gwynn's range is better toward the right field 
line, not nearly as good on balls hit in the gaps. The Yankees will 
be able to run on the arm of Vaughn in left field. Baserunning Veras 
can steal bases (24) this year, and Finley can in a tight spot, as 
well. In general, however, the Padres are a slow, plodding team, though 
Caminiti and Vaughn are good at going first-to-third, and Gwynn won't 
make mistakes on the bases. PITCHING TO THE PADRES Quilvio Veras: 
A switch-hitter who has more power right-handed; should try to pitch 
him down-and-in with breaking balls when he's hitting right-handed, 
jam him with fastballs when he's batting left-handed. Steve Finley: 
A left-handed hitter who likes to pull the ball. Left-handers like 
David Wells can beat him with breaking balls low and outside. Tony 
Gwynn: When he's hot, he's impossible. When he's not hitting well, 
he can be anxious early in the count, and he should be fed breaking 
balls out of the strike zone. Greg Vaughn: Big-time power on anything 
high and over the plate. Because he likes to pull the ball, you must 
pitch him on the outer edge, occasionally jamming him to keep him 
honest. Ken Caminiti: More power right-handed, a better hitter left-handed. 
These days, he's a good lowball hitter and can be beat by fastballs 
up in the zone. Wally Joyner: With runners on base, he'll try to jump 
on a fastball early in the count. Is not a strong hitter and can be 
jammed. Chris Gomez: Like Derek Jeter, likes to hit pitches inside 
out, to right field and through the middle. He can hit with power 
if you make a mistake with a breaking ball. Ruben Rivera: An impatient 
hitter who will chase pitches out of the strike zone. Carlos Hernandez: 
Looks for the first-pitch fastball in the upper half of the strike 
zone. Can struggle against breaking balls. Jim Leyritz: No apparent 
holes right now, can hit fastballs in and away. Best bet is to get 
ahead in the count and try to get him to chase breaking balls. PITCHING 
TO THE YANKEES Chuck Knoblauch: Hard throwers like to jam him with 
fastballs because he stands on top of the plate, which is why he gets 
hit so often. Derek Jeter: Sometimes he has a tendency to chase pitches 
at his feet, but if you don't get the ball in far enough, he can hammer 
the ball over the wall in right. Paul O'Neill: The Yankees' best pure 
hitter, he sometimes will chase fastballs up and away, particularly 
after there is one strike. Bernie Williams: A switch-hitter who has 
trouble resisting chest-high fastballs. When he lays off them, he 
is a much better hitter, and he did this in the last game of the Cleveland 
series. Chili Davis: Has a great eye and will work a pitcher deep 
into a count, but he can be overpowered with fastballs above his belt. 
Cheats some now to get his bat started, making him vulnerable to off-speed 
pitches. Tino Martinez: Nothing seems right at the moment. Is anxious 
and chases pitches out of the strike zone when he falls behind in 
the count, and isn't taking advantage of mistakes when they're made. 
Scott Brosius: A great breaking ball hitter, but he can also drive 
a fastball a long way when he anticipates, as Cleveland's Charles 
Nagy now knows. Jorge Posada: When batting left-handed, he fares very 
poorly against splitters, curveballs and sliders. Ricky Ledee: Like 
all young hitters, he has a tendency to expand the strike zone and 
chase pitches out of the strike zone after falling behind in the count. 
Kevin Brown likely will attack him aggressively. SATURDAY'S PITCHERS 
Kevin Brown: Best sinking fastball in the game (91-93) mph, a four-seam 
fastball of 95-97 mph to throw high in the strike zone, a slider that 
breaks down and away from right-handed batters, and a forkball that 
dives at 88-89 mph. Holds runners well. David Wells: Aggressive, aggressive, 
aggressive, challenging hitters with fastballs. His curveball can 
be exceptional, and his changeup has improved. Throw strikes: Allowed 
as many home runs (29) as walks (29), but has not allowed a three-run 
homer or a grand slam all year.

The last time they were seen on the field at Yankee Stadium, they 
were inadvertently influencing the outcome of the game that sent the 
Cleveland Indians home and the Yankees to the World Series. That's 
not to say the umpires will mess up in the World Series, but they 
have shown they are eminently capable of interfering with the natural 
progression of postseason games. All right, so Ted Hendry won't be 
in the World Series; the umpires' collective bargaining agreement 
with the leagues does not allow an umpire to work both a league championship 
series and the World Series. Joe Brinkman won't be here either, even 
though the agreement does allow for an umpire to work both a division 
series and the World Series. The three American League umpires who 
are on the six-man World Series crew did work in the first round of 
the playoffs. One of them, Richie Garcia, will be the crew chief and 
behind the plate in Saturday night's opener at Yankee Stadium. Gene 
Budig, the AL president, Friday called Garcia, a 24-year veteran, 
one of the league's ``most respected umpires.'' But after Saturday 
night, Garcia will move to right field Sunday night for Game 2. Now 
why does that combination sound familiar, Richie Garcia and right 
field? Ah yes, the last time Garcia worked a post-season series at 
Yankee Stadium, he was the umpire in Game 1 of the league championship 
series two years ago when a young fan from New Jersey _ no name, please; 
he has been over-glorified enough _ reached over the fence and caught 
Derek Jeter's fly ball just as Tony Tarasco, Baltimore's right fielder, 
prepared to catch it. Garcia ruled no interference, that it was a 
home run, then said oops after watching a television replay clearly 
showing interference. Too late. The call helped the Yankees win the 
first game and set the tone for the series. ``Even though he made 
a mistake, you know you have the best out there,'' a baseball official, 
speaking on the condition of anonymity, said. That knowledge comes 
as small consolation to the Orioles. Budig, too, acknowledged that 
umpires, like players and managers, aren't perfect. ``Major league 
umpires are skilled at what they do, but they are human,'' he said 
in a telephone interview. ``Day in and day out they do a very good 
job for Major League Baseball. Rounds one and two have been difficult, 
but that happens from time to time.'' The umpires were so human in 
the American League playoffs that it happened from time to time to 
time to time. The Cleveland Indians suffered the brunt of the fallibility 
of the umpires. ``We had a highlight reel of umpires getting knocked 
down by baseballs,'' general manager John Hart said after the Indians' 
final game against the Yankees. ``The umpires didn't lose the game 
for us, but we had our share of controversies in two playoff series 
with umpires.'' In the division series against Boston, Brinkman, the 
plate umpire, was so bad with his calls on pitches and plays at the 
plate that he immediately provoked disputes that led to his ejecting 
of Mike Hargrove, the Indians' manager, three pitches into Game 2, 
and Dwight Gooden, their starting pitcher, 19 pitches later. Hendry 
was right or wrong, depending on one's point of view, for his noncall 
of interference on Travis Fryman in the 12th inning of Game 2 of the 
ALCS. That ruling went in favor of the Indians. Little else did. In 
Game 4, Jeter was stealing second in the fifth inning when the on-target 
throw from Sandy Alomar Jr. hit Jim McKean, who jumped to try to get 
out of the way but instead kicked the ball into right field. A batted 
ball, Omar Vizquel's line drive, struck Hendry in Game 6. But the 
worst call of Game 6 was Hendry's on a force play at second base. 
Hendry called Bernie Williams safe, ruling that Vizquel's foot came 
off the base before he caught the ball. Members of the Yankees indicated 
Friday that they, too, thought the call was wrong. ``I don't know,'' 
Williams said when asked what he thought, ``but I'll take it. It was 
a big play.'' But did he think he was out? ``I'd rather not comment 
about that,'' he said. ``It will stir a lot of controversy. I don't 
want to get into that.'' When a player believes he was safe, he says 
so and doesn't worry about any subsequent controversy. If Williams 
was implying that he thought he was out, another member of the Yankees 
said he had no doubt that Williams was out. ``I wasn't sure at first,'' 
this uniformed member of the team said, ``but when I saw it was Hendry, 
I said uh-oh. I also thought Omar is so smooth you'd think he wouldn't 
come off the bag. Then I saw the replay. He was out.'' The game today 
is faster than it used to be, this observer said. The umpires have 
to be sharper. Maybe Garcia, Dale Scott and Tim Tschida from the American 
League, and Jerry Crawford, Dana DeMuth and Mark Hirschbeck from the 
National League, will be as sharp as an 18th century French guillotine 
in these four to seven games. Leonard Coleman, the NL president, said 
he thought his umpires were first-rate in the division and league 
series and added that he has ``three splendid umpires'' working the 
World Series. Budig said: ``The World Series crew is proven and first-rate. 
We have total confidence in them.'' The umpires should let the players 
make the errors and the managers the bad decisions. Then everyone 
will talk about the players and managers and not the umpires. 
 NYT19981017.0052 
As Bernie Williams starts what could be his final series with the 
Yankees in Game 1 of the World Series at Yankee Stadium Saturday night, 
he wants to do it with a free mind. Free of worrying about his extremely 
uncertain future and an undisclosed personal matter that has made 
this post-season as perplexing as it has been pleasing. But it is 
not easy to keep the mind uncluttered. Williams does not know if he 
will sign with the Yankees and return to center field next season, 
because he wants to test free agency. There is a good chance the Yankees 
will not offer him the most lavish contract, so Williams might be 
forced to decide between the fattest paycheck and a new situation 
in the baseball city of his choice or a pretty fat paycheck and a 
familiar situation in the Bronx. Scott Boras, Williams' agent, compared 
his client with players in the $10 million-a-year bracket last season, 
so that price tag has surely escalated after Williams won the American 
League batting title with a .339 average while drilling 26 homers 
and knocking in 97 runs. Williams was asked if he agreed with the 
theory that other teams will outbid the Yankees. ``I do not know,'' 
said Williams, who has been aloof during this post-season, but has 
declined to discuss why. ``And I'm thinking about this a little more 
than I would like to. I would like to keep my focus on the series.'' 
It is not an issue Williams or the Yankees wants to study Saturday 
or in the coming days, because the team is four victories away from 
a championship. Still, it is an issue that hovers over the Yankees 
as ominously as the owner George Steinbrenner hovers over general 
manager Brian Cashman. ``It's a tough thing,'' Cashman said about 
balancing the excitement of being in the World Series with the reality 
of trying to re-sign Williams. ``You know the ugliness of the future 
is right in front of you.'' Although Williams has been adamant about 
not discussing the future, he relented slightly Friday. When a reporter 
asked him what the reasons would be for staying with the Yankees, 
Williams' answer included an escape clause. ``Just the fact that I've 
been here my whole career,'' Williams said. ``That has a lot to do 
with it. The relationships that I've come to know during the years, 
I think it would be very hard, but not impossible, to start from scratch 
somewhere else.'' Williams continued: ``But I think the reality of 
the game in this day and age is things happen. You can't really write 
things in stone that they're going to happen. People get traded. People 
become free agents and go to other teams. I have to make a decision 
really thinking about all the people I'm accountable for.'' When Williams 
was asked what better situation could a player have than being the 
center fielder for the Yankees, winning a batting crown and being 
in the World Series, the 30-year-old was stumped. ``Wow, that's pretty 
good right there,'' Williams said. ``It's funny you mention that, 
because I really haven't thought about any of that. I think, at some 
point in the off season, I was going to sit down and think, wow, it 
wasn't a bad year at all.'' While Cashman would not discuss financial 
matters, another Yankee official said the team will not offer Williams 
as much as $12 million a year _ unless Steinbrenner gets generous 
after a possible championship. It is more likely that the Yanks would 
offer Williams in the $10 million-a-year range. ``I'd hate to have 
to speculate on something at this point,'' Cashman said. ``We'll give 
it our best effort to sign him at a level that we're comfortable with. 
Hopefully, that will be enough. Then we'll have a marriage. If not, 
we'll have a divorce.'' While Williams has earned the right to become 
a free agent and pursue the contract he wants in the city he wants, 
he has interesting choices to make. When a reporter asked Williams 
how he would respond to someone who suggested that he accept less 
from the Yankees to remain in a city where he is popular, where he 
likes his teammates and manager, and where the team has been in the 
post-season for four straight years, he did not hesitate to answer. 
``My response to that would be it's not the time right now to start 
thinking about that,'' Williams said. ``If I start thinking about 
that, it'll distract me to what I need to do in the World Series.'' 
Williams then talked about how the Yankees are at the end of a remarkable 
season and how he did not want his situation to disrupt that. But, 
with Williams' status uncertain, he was asked if the next four to 
seven games would be bittersweet, since he could be ending a 13-year 
association with the Yankees. ``I don't want to talk about that,'' 
Williams said. ``I'm going to have a lot of fun out there. I'm going 
to go all out.'' Then Williams walked away from the interview.

Talk about high expectations. It's not just the man from Tampa who 
has them anymore. Knowing their baseball as well as they do, everybody 
in the Joe Torre family passed up tickets for the divisional series 
and the league championship series as just so much parsley on the 
plate of life. ``The pressure was on to get to the World Series, so 
I can see all those people,'' Torre, the Yankees' manager, was saying 
before New York went out to play the here-we-are, let's-go-for-it 
San Diego Padres in the Stadium Saturday night. Now that the Yankees 
are in the Series, their Florida-based owner and their fans and they 
themselves can see nothing more appropriate than four more victories. 
Anything less than 125 would feel like emptiness. But why should the 
Yankees be any different from the six teams that already fell off 
the bus to this World Series? The gloom and doom in the six other 
cities will not compare to the letdown that would grip New York and 
the owner's insatiable little heart should the Yanks come up short. 
The three-tiered playoff system has practically turned baseball into 
football, where the survival-of-the-fittest mentality produces one 
exalted Super Bowl champion and a league full of chumps and losers, 
condemned to a nether world of Parcells-like demons kicking them in 
their sore spots for eternity. The World Series used to be a short 
and sweet reward for excellence, but that was when there were eight 
teams per league, and the winners met in daylight in early October. 
Even if the Yankees clubbed my poor Brooklyn Dodgers into submission 
once again, well, there was always next year. But in 1969, baseball 
began league championship series, and in 1995 it began a two-layered 
playoff system. The World Series is still different, which is why 
we should all resist the babble of ``post-season records'' flung at 
us by the hyperactive computers and the hyperactive broadcasters from 
the dozens of different networks that carry baseball. The World Series 
is still a competition between one league that encourages pitchers 
to be athletes and another league relatively devoid of strategy. Somehow 
the ``playoffs'' leave just about everybody feeling inadequate. Think 
about it. The Houston Astros are going around feeling they cannot 
perform in the post-season. The Texas Rangers are sulking because 
they had the best hitting in the league and could hardly touch Yankee 
pitching when it counted. In Chicago, the glory of winning a special 
playoff for the wild-card spot and Sammy Sosa's 66 home runs has been 
pre-empted. The very city that beat the Cubs for the 1969 eastern 
title held a parade for Sosa Saturday in the canyons where Lindbergh 
and John Glenn and the 1969 Mets were once hailed. Speaking of indignity, 
there are the Red Sox, whose occasional qualification for the playoffs 
is merely a signal that nothing good can come of it. In Atlanta, the 
team of the '90s has won exactly one World Series, and now it is up 
to management to keep repeating that: ``The main goal is to get to 
the Series. This is a recorded announcement. This is a recorded announcement. 
This is a recorded announcement.'' In Cleveland, the fans had to live 
with the phrase ``Nineteen forty-eight!'' being chanted at the Indians 
in the Bronx as the Yankees put the Indians out of misery. That leaves 
the Padres as the only team with virtually nothing to lose. This can 
be good, or it can be bad. Bruce Bochy, the manager, a reserve on 
the 1984 San Diego World Series team, has said: ``A lot of the players 
on that team said, looking back, we wish we would have had a little 
different attitude instead of just saying, `Hey, we are in the World 
Series.' And this year, I think you will see the players out there 
playing to win.'' Torre recalled being the underdog in 1996, but he 
said his Yankees felt they could beat the Braves. ``I am sure that 
is the way the Padres feel right now, that maybe other people aren't 
predicting a lot for them, but I am sure they are for themselves,'' 
Torre said. ``I think getting here is where the pressure is,'' Torre 
added. ``You want to win, but getting to the World Series is so tough 
after playing 162 games and getting into post-season and then having 
to fight, bite and scratch and everything else to get here.'' Torre 
continued: ``You don't think about in spring training that we want 
to go and win the World Series. You want to get to the World Series. 
Then you get there, well, you have played well enough and won enough 
games, then of course, we want to win. ``As far as legitimizing our 
season _ I hate to even think in negative terms, but if San Diego 
happens to win the World Series, sure it takes a little bit of the 
luster off what we have accomplished by getting here, but I think 
that was our goal, initially.'' The key word in that sentence is ``initially.'' 
The Yankees built an insatiable demand for more victories _ and World 
Series tickets in the Torre family. While they're at it, the Yankees 
had better win the whole thing. They are a victim of their own excellence.

A new shipment of bats arrived for Tino Martinez on Friday, and he 
massaged the handles to make sure they were thin enough, knocked on 
the barrels and listened for a certain sound and swung them slowly 
again and again. Martinez was so excited about the fresh bats, he 
reacted like a Little Leaguer who was wielding an aluminum bat for 
the first time. ``You were saving the World Series trees until now, 
right?'' Martinez said to the representative from the bat company. 
``These are from World Series trees, aren't they?'' Martinez could 
joke about the bats being specially designed for the World Series 
because the Yankees began their quest for a second title in the past 
three years when they play host to the San Diego Padres in Game 1 
at Yankee Stadium Saturday night. Major leaguer players who were watching 
on television could not imitate David Letterman and joke about World 
Series wood. Even though Martinez has struggled with numerous bats 
during the post-season, he could joke because the Yankees are still 
alive for the title. Martinez is still alive. For now, Martinez, the 
power hitter who has mostly been missing in action, could joke around. 
For now. ``You always get a fresh start in the post-season because 
it's game to game,'' said Martinez. ``If you win, you've got another 
game the next day so you forget about the bad at-bats. It's easier 
to do that in post-season because your next at-bat could be the biggest 
at-bat of the season.'' Normally, having Martinez at the plate for 
the biggest at-bat of the season would be a pleasing sight to the 
Yankees. But not when the calendar flips to October. Martinez has 
experienced another frustrating post-season. He is 5 for 30 with 10 
strikeouts, no homers and only 1 run batted in for a hitting-starved 
team that has batted .229 while still winning 7 of 9 post-season games 
because of superior pitching. Can the Yankees continue to win if Martinez, 
their most valuable run producer, is a sometime singles hitter? ``We've 
just gotten through two good series,'' said Paul O'Neill. ``The Yankees 
won those series. You don't focus on one guy. You focus on winning. 
The whole team won.'' As much as Joe Torre talked about Martinez needing 
one line-drive hit to get him in a groove, the 30-year-old first baseman 
is in a career drought in the post-season. Since joining the Yankees, 
Martinez is 20 for 107 (.187) with one homer and 4 RBI in 29 post-season 
games. Those are puny statistics, especially for a player who has 
driven in 381 runs in 455 regular season games over the last three 
years. ``I would guess that Tino would have a great series,'' O'Neill 
said. ``Baseball has a way of evening things out. You have a bad series, 
you come back and have a great series. In the season, that's easier 
to do. In the post-season, it gets tougher.'' It cannot get much tougher 
for Martinez, who was dropped from fifth to sixth in the order during 
the American League Championship Series against the Cleveland Indians 
and will remain in that spot until further notice. Martinez has blamed 
his paucity of production on impatience and on trying to do too much. 
He has sometimes flailed at poor pitches during hitter's counts of 
3-1 and 2-0, instead of working the count, and he has admitted that 
his previous failures in the post-season have caused him to pursue 
the obviously unattainable five-run homer. Actually, Martinez has 
already made some alterations, and he has reached base 7 times in 
his last 10 plates appearances on a double, a single, a hit-by-pitch 
and 4 walks. It is not enough to pacify George Steinbrenner, but it 
is something for him to cling to. Until last night, anyway, when Martinez 
had to face Kevin Brown, a nasty right-hander who had retired him 
in 30 of 34 career at-bats. ``If I was getting good pitches and missing 
them, then I'd say I have a bad swing working,'' said Martinez. ``But 
I've been swinging at bad pitches. Right now, I've just got to be 
patient and wait.'' The Yankees will wait with him. They have to. 
In the 1996 World Series, Torre started Cecil Fielder over Martinez 
at first in Games 3, 4 and 5. It was a difficult decision because 
Martinez had paced the team in RBI while Fielder did not join the 
Yankees until July 31. But the Yankees grabbed all three games so 
it worked. Torre does not have such an attractive replacement this 
season in Luis Sojo. So the Yankees will stay with Martinez, for better 
or worse, while he tries to stay positive and finally produce. ``It's 
the World Series,'' said Martinez. ``You got to go out there and have 
fun with it. Big games are all big games. You want to go out there 
and enjoy that game and try to do your best to win that game. You 
don't think that you might lose that day.''

Chuck Knoblauch and Tino Martinez were as popular as squeegee men 
a week ago, the speculation rampant that one or the other or both 
might be exiled if the Yankees' historic year crumbled in the post-season. 
Two big hits in the midst of a big inning changed all that Saturday 
night in Game 1 of the World Series. The Yankees trailed San Diego, 
5-2, in the seventh inning, but Knoblauch hit a three-run home run 
to tie the score, and five batters later, Martinez smashed a grand 
slam. The seven-run explosion rocketed the Yankees to a 9-6 victory 
in the opener of the four-of-seven-game series, before 56,712 at Yankee 
Stadium. Orlando Hernandez will pitch against Andy Ashby in Game 2 
Sunday night at the Stadium. Beyond seizing the advantage in the series, 
the Yankees were able to neutralize the Padres' ace, Kevin Brown, 
driving him from the mound in the seventh. Brown, seen by many as 
San Diego's best hope for a World Series upset, will not pitch again 
until Game 4, at the earliest. Brown was pitching with a three-run 
lead after the top of the fifth, when Tony Gwynn and Greg Vaughn banged 
back-to-back homers. One out into the seventh, however, Jorge Posada 
hit a single, and Brown walked Ricky Ledee. Brown, who had thrown 
a whopping 64 pitches in the first three innings, went out, and the 
reliever Donne Wall came in to face Knoblauch. This is what the Yankees 
have done all season, force a starter from the game in the middle 
innings, before exploiting a middle reliever. Knoblauch, of course, 
had earned notoriety for his gaffe in the Game 2 of the American League 
Championship Series against Cleveland, standing and waiting for an 
interference call as the ball rolled to a stop behind him and the 
decisive run scored. The Yankees came back to win the series, however; 
Knoblauch got a reprieve and talked about how much the experience 
had helped him. Facing Wall with a one-ball, no-strike count, Knoblauch 
had to duck under a runaway fastball. Two balls, no strikes. Wall 
had to throw a strike, Knoblauch swung hard and lifted a high fly 
down the left-field line. Off the bat, it did not look like much. 
But it kept carrying, Vaughn drifting back in left and looking up, 
to see the ball disappear into the stands. Tie game. Yankee Stadium 
shook. Knoblauch rounded the bases, crossed home plate and thrust 
both arms into the air, yelling to the crowd, like a hyped Olympic 
weightlifter who had just successfully hoisted a half-ton. He stomped 
around the dugout, his helmet on, teammates banging on him happily. 
When Derek Jeter singled, nobody really noticed. Wall left the game, 
and Mark Langston took over. Paul O'Neill flied out, and after Jeter 
advanced on a wild pitch, Bernie Williams was intentionally walked. 
Chili Davis drew a walk. Bases loaded, once more, with Martinez coming 
to the plate, with exactly one run batted in in his first 76 career 
at-bats in league championship and World Series games. With the count 
two balls and two strikes, Langston threw a pitch near the outside 
corner that he thought should have been a strike. Instead, Garcia 
called it a ball. Langston glared, snapping at the return throw. Langston 
and Martinez and everyone on the field now understood that with the 
bases loaded and a 3-2 count, Langston would have to throw what players 
refer to as a cookie _ a tasty pitch over the middle. Martinez ate 
up this cookie. The ball soared into the upper deck in right field, 
lifting three years of post-season misery off the back of the Yankees' 
first baseman, a grand slam. The crowd called out Martinez from the 
dugout again. Like Knoblauch, Martinez pumped both arms, and later 
the crowd would chant his name, and Martinez would wave his cap. San 
Diego's lead was long gone. The Yankees had taken a 2-0 lead over 
Brown in the second inning, forcing him to throw 32 pitches in the 
second. They loaded the bases with a single and two walks, and Ledee, 
the rookie left fielder who is playing because none of Torre's left 
fielders have been hitting, pulled a sinking fastball down the right 
field line with two outs. The fans along the foul line stood, some 
waving to push the ball fair with the body English, and the ball landed 
on the line, skipping off the wall as two runners scored. The Yankees 
had the early edge, they had jumped on Brown, and they had their best 
pitcher on the mound. San Diego's Chris Gomez led off the second inning 
with a blooper over shortstop, the ball falling in for a single. Quilvio 
Veras flied to right, Gwynn grounded out and Gomez took second, bringing 
Vaughn to the plate. David Wells got ahead in the count, no balls 
and two strikes, with a change-up and a fastball, before trying to 
run a fastball inside on Vaughn, who hit 50 home runs during the regular 
season. Vaughn attacked the pitch: a line drive that landed in the 
second deck, foul all the way, but a frightening mistake. Jorge Posada, 
the Yankees' catcher, jogged to the mound to re-think the strategy, 
perhaps to remind Wells of the conventional wisdom: you must pitch 
Vaughn on the outer edge of the plate. Posada returned to the plate, 
called for an outside fastball, Wells threw. Vaughn's swing was short 
and quick, the ball making a click sound off the bat, like a well-struck 
golf ball, before carrying over the wall in right-center field. Tie 
game. Wells retired the first two batters in the fifth inning, before 
jamming Veras with an inside fastball. Veras' bat snapped on contact, 
but it was enough to send a looper into short center field, a single. 
Gwynn stepped in, having hit a single in his first two at-bats, and 
looked for a sign from the third base coach Tim Flannery. With a runner 
on first, he likes to try to pull a ball through the right side of 
the infield. Wells fired a fastball, Gwynn turned on the pitch and 
ripped it, a line drive that crashed off the facing of the upper deck 
in right field. The Padres jumped from the dugout, celebrating, as 
Wells turned away, disgusted, asking for a new baseball. He got one, 
delivered another fastball, and Vaughn slugged this deep into the 
left field stands. Two pitches, two home runs, the first back-to-back 
home runs allowed by Wells since April 30. San Diego led, 5-2, and 
Yankee Stadium was silent. It would not stay that way.
