President Boris Yeltsin has suffered minor burns on his right hand, 
his press office said Thursday. Asked about small bandages that were 
visible on Yeltsin's hand during an awards ceremony, the press office 
said the president had sustained small burns. It did not say what 
had caused them.

President Boris Yeltsin's doctors have pronounced his health ``more 
or less normal,'' his wife Naina said in an interview published Wednesday. 
Mrs. Yeltsin told the Argumenty i Fakty weekly that she hesitated 
even to touch on her husband's health ``when there is so much conjecture 
on this topic.'' Still, she noted that he had regular medical check-ups. 
``The doctors say now: Everything is more or less normal,'' Mrs. Yeltsin 
declared. The 67-year-old Yeltsin's health has long been a concern, 
and the worry has been amplified by the secrecy surrounding his condition. 
Yeltsin suffered from heart disease during the 1996 presidential election 
and had a heart attack, followed by multiple bypass surgery, in the 
months after his victory. Mrs. Yeltsin expressed understanding for 
Russians who took part Wednesday in protests for unpaid wages. She 
also said that criticism of the president was normal, though it was 
offensive when it focused on anything other than his professional 
performance, such as his age. ``It seems to me ... that people expected 
a miracle from him,'' Mrs. Yeltsin said. ``But surely you can't curse 
a person for not being a magician.'' Mrs. Yeltsin refuted rumors that 
her family would leave Russia after Yeltsin leaves office in 2000 
as ``absolute nonsense.'' ``I think we'll live like all normal people. 
At least it will be calmer than it is now.''

President Boris Yeltsin, on his first trip out of Russia since this 
spring, canceled a welcoming ceremony in Uzbekistan on Sunday because 
he wasn't feeling well, his spokesman said. Yeltsin appeared stiff 
and stumbled during another public ceremony after he arrived in Tashkent, 
the capital of this Central Asian nation, and had to be supported 
by Uzbek President Islam Karimov. But the two later held a one-on-one 
summit as scheduled. The trip is Yeltsin's first high-profile foray 
since an economic crisis swamped his country in August. The 67-year-old 
president, whose health has often sidelined him during his seven years 
in power, has spent most of the last two months out of the limelight 
and out of the Kremlin, holding meetings in his country home outside 
Moscow. His last foreign trip was to Britain in May, when he attended 
a summit of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations. During 
his visits to Uzbekistan and Kazakstan this week, Yeltsin is expected 
to discuss improving Russia's relations with the two former Soviet 
republics, whose economies have suffered residual effects of the crisis 
that hit Russia after it devalued its currency in August and defaulted 
on some of its debt. On Sunday, Yeltsin had been scheduled to lay 
wreaths at a monument to Alisher Naboi, an 16th century Uzbek poet, 
and salute an Uzbek honor guard, but both ceremonies were canceled. 
``This week was extremely tense. (Yeltsin) was affected by a difficult 
flight and the end of a difficult week,'' Yeltsin's chief spokesman, 
Dmitry Yakushkin, told a news conference. ``He has a cold. He was 
coughing when we spoke.'' It was sunny and about 14 degrees C (57 
degrees F) in Tashkent on Sunday. Yakushkin said Yeltsin's schedule 
Monday may also change depending on how he feels. Yeltsin and Karimov 
later met at a government residence outside Tashkent and signed several 
agreements on fighting smuggling and other crime and expanding cultural 
ties. The two sides are expected to sign economic agreements Monday. 
Later Monday, Yeltsin is to go to Kazakstan, where he and Kazak President 
Nursultan Nazarbayev are expected to sign agreements on economic, 
science and technical cooperation and on combating drug trafficking. 
Last week, Yeltsin said he also planned to discuss the situation in 
Afghanistan with his Uzbek and Kazak counterparts. Russia and the 
two republics fear an influx of refugees and weapons from Afghanistan, 
and possibly a spillover of fighting that has wracked the country. 
Yeltsin was accompanied by Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, Defense Minister 
Igor Sergeyev, Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov, officials from the 
Federal Border Guard Service, the State Customs Committee, the Defense 
Ministry, and the Russian Academy of Sciences.

Doctors ordered Russian President Boris Yeltsin to cut short his Central 
Asian trip because of a respiratory infection and he agreed to return 
home Monday, a day earlier than planned, officials said. Yeltsin was 
suffering from tracheobronchitis, had a fever of 37.4 Celsius (99.3 
Fahrenheit) and was being treated with antibiotics, the president's 
doctors told the Interfax news agency. Yeltsin was to fly back to 
Moscow late Monday, rather than on Tuesday as scheduled, but was going 
ahead with talks, including a meeting with Kazak President Nursultan 
Nazarbayev. He planned to move up all his scheduled meetings before 
returning home, aides said. The 67-year-old, 3rd graf pvs

Russian President Boris Yeltsin cut short a trip to Central Asia on 
Monday due to a respiratory infection that revived questions about 
his overall health and ability to lead Russia through a sustained 
economic crisis. Yeltsin's premature return to Moscow also prompted 
doubts about his capacity to respond decisively in the Kosovo crisis, 
in which Russia has been leading a campaign to forestall airstrikes. 
Moscow's NTV station said it was a crucial time for Russia, when ``presidential 
decisions'' are needed. There was no indication that Yeltsin's illness 
would sideline him for any length of time, and aides said the president 
would maintain his schedule for the rest of the week. But after a 
series of health problems in recent years, including heart bypass 
surgery in 1996, every new ailment unleashes a flurry of speculation 
about the president's ability to function. The president insists he 
has no major health problems and will serve out the remaining two 
years of his term. Yeltsin's aides said the president was taking antibiotics 
to ward off a bout of bronchitis and a mild fever of 37.4 Celsius 
(99.3 Fahrenheit). There were no plans to hospitalize Yeltsin, who 
arrived in Moscow late Monday night from Almaty, Kazakstan, a day 
earlier than planned.

President Boris Yeltsin stayed home Tuesday, nursing a respiratory 
infection that forced him to cut short a foreign trip and revived 
concerns about his ability to govern. Yeltsin was spending the day 
at his Gorky-9 country residence just outside Moscow, and will probably 
not go into the office all week, his spokesman, Dmitry Yakushkin, 
told reporters. However, Yeltsin's condition was stable, Yakushkin 
said. Doctors insisted Monday that Yeltsin fly home from Central Asia 
a day ahead of schedule because he was suffering from an upper respiratory 
infection and had a mild fever of 37.4 Celsius (99.3 F). They said 
Yeltsin was being treated with antibiotics and there were no plans 
to hospitalize him. Yeltsin, 67, has a history of health problems, 
including quintuple heart bypass surgery two years ago, so whenever 
he gets sick there is a flurry of speculation about his ability to 
function. Yeltsin insists he has no major illness and plans to serve 
out the remaining two years of his term. Yakushkin, his spokesman, 
reiterated Tuesday there was no talk about an early resignation. ``It's 
not being discussed,'' he said. ``I am personally against such a resignation 
because I think it would only bring peril to the nation.'' Yakushkin 
and other aides sought to play down the seriousness of Yeltsin's illness. 
``Don't panic, Dad is OK,'' Yeltsin's daughter Tatiana Dyachenko, 
who is his official image adviser, told the Kommersant business newspaper. 
Yakushkin said Yeltsin's personal doctor, Sergei Mironov, confirmed 
that the president was suffering from a respiratory infection known 
as tracheal bronchitis and that ``his condition is stable.'' ``He 
must stay in bed like any other person,'' Yakushkin said. ``However, 
knowing the president's character, he is certain to start working 
with documents and making phone calls to Russian politicians as well 
as foreign leaders in view of the current situation in Kosovo.'' But 
the Nezavisimaya Gazeta newspaper said in a front-page editorial Tuesday 
that Yeltsin's condition suggests he is suffering from something worse 
than a cold. It said his absence from the Kremlin during the current 
economic crisis ``amounts to a state catastrophe'' and called on Yeltsin 
to immediately surrender most of his powers to Prime Minister Yevgeny 
Primakov. A Communist lawmaker also called for ``an urgent medical 
check ... on the Russian president's health'' to determine whether 
he is fit to remain in office, the Interfax news agency said. ``Yeltsin's 
obvious inability to perform his functions is damaging Russian state 
authority, as power is being misused by the clique close to the president,'' 
said Viktor Ilyukhin, chairman of parliament's security committee. 
The health of the president, who is also commander-in-chief of the 
Russian military, ``is a direct threat to the country's national security 
and a factor of serious concern regarding Russia's nuclear weapons,'' 
he said. Other newspapers gave a detailed description of Yeltsin's 
weaknesses and his erratic behavior on the trip to the former Soviet 
republics of Uzbekistan and Kazakstan _ his first foray abroad since 
a visit to Britain in May. The president appeared stiff and stumbled 
when he arrived Sunday in Uzbekistan's capital of Tashkent. He had 
to be supported by Uzbek President Islam Karimov and canceled his 
other public events. At a state dinner on Sunday, Yeltsin made rambling 
remarks, expressing his satisfaction with local ``facilities and stores'' 
he never inspected, the daily Kommersant reported. On Monday, ``the 
president didn't seem to understand that he wasn't in Moscow,'' Kommersant 
said, saying he called aides and spoke as though they were late for 
work at the Kremlin. He turned up more than an hour late for talks 
with Uzbek officials, making some incoherent remarks interrupted by 
a bad cough and abruptly cutting short a scheduled news conference.

Weakened by a cold yet animated, President Boris Yeltsin defied doctors' 
orders and quashed rumors he is seriously ill by showing up unexpectedly 
at the Kremlin on Wednesday. Still, his appearance didn't silence 
the growing number of calls for his resignation. Hours after he returned 
to work, the generally pro-Yeltsin upper house of parliament fell 
just 11 votes short of passing a motion urging him to step down over 
his social welfare policies. Yeltsin, 67, has a respiratory infection 
that forced him to cut short his first foreign visit in months on 
Monday. Whenever Yeltsin falls ill, speculation arises about his ability 
to govern. This time, however, the prospect of him leaving office 
has aroused less panic, since he has largely faded from the limelight 
in recent months and left his government to grapple with Russia's 
economic crisis. ``There will be no turmoil if Yeltsin leaves the 
political arena. The government is already in charge, (Prime Minister 
Yevgeny) Primakov is strong enough and has the support of the security 
services,'' said Yevgeny Volk, director of the Moscow office of the 
U.S.-based Heritage Foundation. ``Everyone knows Yeltsin is ailing 
and is politically weakened,'' he said. Yeltsin has a history of health 
problems, and underwent heart bypass surgery in 1996. Still, he insists 
he has no major illnesses and plans to serve out the remaining two 
years of his term. ``I can't even sneeze'' without someone making 
a fuss about it, he joked with Primakov during a meeting Wednesday. 
In the Kremlin, Yeltsin discussed developments in Kosovo with Primakov, 
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, Russian 
news agencies said. Yeltsin looked wan and tired and walked stiffly, 
but he was smiling, gesturing animatedly and joking with his ministers. 
The start of the meeting was shown on Russian television. Primakov 
said afterward that Yeltsin waved his hand dismissively ``when we 
reminded him that he should stay in bed during his illness'' and said 
of his doctors: ``Don't listen to them.'' The upper house of parliament 
was busy voting on a motion saying he should resign. The vote in the 
Federation Council, which is made up of regional leaders, was 79 to 
18 in favor, Russian news agencies reported. It did not pass because 
it required a simple majority of 90 votes. The motion carries no legal 
weight, but it reflects growing anti-Yeltsin sentiment in a chamber 
that has generally supported him. The prime minister reiterated Wednesday 
that Yeltsin has no plans to resign or call early elections. ``There 
is no reason for rocking the boat and demanding anyone's resignation,'' 
Primakov said, according to the Interfax news agency. ``What happens 
to the anti-crisis steps if elections are held now?'' Yeltsin's resignation 
is highly unlikely. If he were to step down or die, Primakov would 
take power and elections would have to be held within three months. 
Many Russians view Yeltsin with increasing pity. ``I feel for him. 
He's clearly not a healthy person,'' film director Vladimir Khotinenko 
was quoted as saying by the daily Kommersant. ``It's time for him 
to step aside.'' Doctors ordered the president to stay in bed Tuesday 
and his spokesman, Dmitry Yakushkin, had said Yeltsin would not be 
in the office all week. Yeltsin stumbled and had to be supported during 
his visit to Central Asia on Sunday and Monday. He canceled most of 
his public engagements, except for a state dinner at which he made 
rambling remarks and a news conference that he abruptly cut short.

Russia's Constitutional Court opened hearings Thursday on whether 
Boris Yeltsin can seek a third term. The issue was controversial earlier 
this year when Yeltsin refused to spell out his intentions and his 
aides insisted he had the legal right to seek re-election. It has 
lost some of its urgency, as Yeltsin has grown physically and politically 
weaker and has said he will not run again. The Russian Constitution 
has a two-term limit for presidents. But Yeltsin's aides say his first 
term, from 1991 to 1996, does not count because it began six months 
before the Soviet Union collapsed and before the current constitution 
took effect. Communists and other Yeltsin opponents in parliament's 
lower house, the State Duma, disagreed and appealed to the Constitutional 
Court in February. While the case has been waiting to be heard, events 
have overtaken it. Yeltsin has flatly said he will not seek another 
term, and the opposition has concentrated its efforts on demanding 
an early resignation, riding a wave of popular discontent over the 
economic crisis. The call for Yeltsin to step down was backed by many 
participants in a nationwide labor action earlier this month that 
attracted about 1 million people. Yeltsin's growing health problems 
would also seem to rule out another election campaign. A respiratory 
infection forced him to cut short a trip to Central Asia earlier this 
week. On Wednesday, parliament's upper chamber, the Federation Council, 
voted on a resolution calling on Yeltsin to resign, but it failed 
narrowly. Even if had passed, the move would have had no legal consequences, 
but it highlighted growing anti-Yeltsin sentiments in the chamber 
made up of powerful regional leaders, most of whom have been loyal 
to the president. Mikhail Mityukov, the presidential representative 
on the Constitutional Court, said Thursday that Yeltsin would ignore 
calls for an early resignation. ``The president is a strong person, 
and he has been through far more difficult political situations,'' 
Mityukov said, according to the Interfax news agency.

Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who is still recuperating from his 
latest illness, has canceled a trip to an Asian summit next month, 
his office said Friday. Government sources said the president has 
also called off a visit to Austria later this month, but the Kremlin 
said those plans were still going forward. Yeltsin has decided to 
send Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov to the November summit of the 
Asia-Pacific Economic Forum in Kuala Lumpur because it deals mostly 
with financial issues, Yeltsin's office said. But sources in Primakov's 
office said the cancellation was due to concerns about how the long 
flight might effect the president's health. The president has been 
suffering from bronchitis and a cold this week, which forced him to 
cut short a visit to Central Asia on Monday. He was spending Friday 
at a country home outside Moscow after defying the orders of his doctors 
and working in the Kremlin for the past two days. Aides said the president's 
condition was ``satisfactory.'' Yeltsin is still planning to go to 
Vienna for an Oct. 27-28 summit of European nations, the president's 
office said. In another development, Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, considered 
a potential presidential candidate, said Thursday that he wouldn't 
exclude the possibility of Yeltsin's resignation for health reasons. 
In an interview with the British Broadcasting Corp., he stopped short 
of calling on Yeltsin to step down. But Luzhkov has always been supportive 
of Yeltsin and had never before questioned the president's health 
or ability to govern. ``According to our constitution, the president 
himself has to say he is not able to work,'' Luzhkov said in an interview 
with the BBC in Moscow. ``And because of (Yeltsin's) poor health, 
he is no longer able to give the country as much time as it demands.'' 
Luzhkov's spokesman Mikhail Solomentsev refused to elaborate on the 
statement. Yeltsin has a long history of health problems, including 
a heart bypass surgery two years ago. Each new ailment rekindles speculation 
about his fitness to govern. The president and his doctors say Yeltsin 
has no serious health problems and will serve out the final two years 
of his term.
