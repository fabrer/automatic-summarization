In the summer of 1995, a whiff of revolution was in the air in Silicon 
Valley. The Internet offered a new deal in computing, a fresh opportunity 
for entrepreneurs to try to break Microsoft Corp.'s firm grip on the 
personal computer software business. Leading the challenge was Netscape 
Communications Corp., whose software for browsing the World Wide Web 
had ignited the Internet boom. Netscape chairman James Clark spoke 
boldly of attacking Microsoft head-on. He borrowed imagery from the 
movie ``Star Wars,'' referring to Microsoft as the Death Star and 
Netscape as the leader of a rebel alliance. Microsoft answered with 
a vengeance. It dispatched hundreds of programmers to work on a competing 
browser and poured many millions of dollars into marketing it. It 
prodded computer makers and others to distribute its browser, folded 
the browser into its industry-dominant Windows operating system and 
gave the browser away free _ a campaign intended to ``cut off their 
air supply,'' as a senior Microsoft executive described it. But not 
only competitors like Netscape have encountered Microsoft's force. 
Microsoft's partners, its corporate customers and professional investors 
who finance new ventures have all collided with it. A close look at 
Microsoft's no-holds-barred push into the Internet software business 
offers a window into the ways the company uses its market muscle to 
influence the behavior of virtually every player in the industry. 
Some of the cases recounted here figure prominently in the suit brought 
by the Justice Department and 20 states, scheduled to go to trial 
this month, charging that Microsoft at times went too far _ and violated 
antitrust laws. Regardless of the legal outcome, previously unreported 
details about incidents in the suit and the other examples provide 
a more complete picture of Microsoft in action. _ When Compaq Computer 
Corp. considered loading Netscape's browser instead of Microsoft's 
on its personal computers, Microsoft threatened to stop selling its 
Windows operating system to Compaq. The company quickly changed its 
mind. _ After Spyglass Inc. began supplying Microsoft with its early 
browser technology, Microsoft announced that it would give away its 
browser free. The timing came as a rude surprise to its partner Spyglass. 
The company lost most of its revenues almost overnight, as the technology, 
which it had also been licensing to companies besides Microsoft, suddenly 
became available free. _ When America Online Inc., which competes 
fiercely with Microsoft's online service and electronic commerce divisions, 
went shopping for browser technology, Microsoft made an offer that 
was too good to pass up: If America Online used Microsoft's browser 
as the main one for its millions of subscribers, Microsoft would give 
America Online prime placement on the desktop screen of all personal 
computers using Windows. _ When Intel Corp. began developing its own 
Internet software, Microsoft complained. Intel, the leading maker 
of the microprocessors that serve as the electronic brains on most 
personal computers running Windows, pulled back. The chip maker decided 
that its lucrative hand-in-glove partnership with Microsoft took priority. 
_ Microsoft's reach in computing has become so pervasive that nearly 
every year now, Silicon Valley's top venture capitalists meet privately 
with a team of top Microsoft executives to learn about the company's 
plans. The goal, one venture investor observed, was to ``stay out 
of the way of the steamroller.'' Microsoft adamantly denies that it 
has broken any laws in these or similar situations. The company plays 
the game of business hard, and its executives acknowledge that without 
apology. Yes, Microsoft says, rivals may suffer and partners may be 
irritated occasionally. But the company insists its actions are guided 
by its main corporate goal of bringing new technology inexpensively 
and conveniently to the millions of people who use its software. Most 
people in the computer industry say that living in Microsoft's world 
means routinely making accommodations to it. Microsoft's power emanates 
from its near-monopoly on the market for personal computer operating 
systems, the master control programs that run computers. ``Because 
it owns the operating system, Microsoft is the essential utility of 
the information age,'' said James Moore, president of Geopartners 
Research Inc., a technology consulting firm. ``It acts as a kind of 
gatekeeper to the pipeline of computing innovation, sitting there 
and deciding whether to help some innovation or slow it down.'' For 
months, Microsoft and Netscape had talked on and off, circling each 
other warily. But the event that would define them as unflinching 
rivals was a meeting on June 21, 1995, in a second-floor conference 
room at Netscape's headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. That meeting, 
according to the Justice Department and 20 states suing Microsoft, 
was the high-tech equivalent of the storied gatherings in smoke-filled 
railroad cars that inspired passage of the nation's antitrust laws 
a century ago. On that day, they say, Microsoft made Netscape an illegal 
offer to divvy up the market for Internet browsing software, a collusion 
pact that Netscape rejected. Microsoft replies that the prosecutors 
are misinterpreting a routine meeting in the software business and 
that the company has never tried to divide the browser market. Bill 
Gates, Microsoft's chairman and principal strategist, did not attend 
the Mountain View gathering, but he consulted by telephone with the 
Microsoft team. Two people who did attend that June meeting have been 
named as witnesses in the trial scheduled to begin next week: Netscape 
president James Barksdale and Daniel Rosen, Microsoft's general manager 
of new technology. In the trial, the government will contend that 
Microsoft presented Netscape with an all-or-nothing offer, according 
to people who have been questioned in the federal investigation. Relying 
heavily on notes taken in the meeting by Netscape executive vice president 
Marc Andreessen and on the testimony of Barksdale, prosecutors are 
expected to assert that the Microsoft proposal had several elements, 
both incentives and requirements. Microsoft, according to the people 
questioned by the government, would invest in Netscape, taking a 15 
to 20 percent stake, give Netscape technical information and fine-tune 
Microsoft's operating systems so that Netscape's software would run 
better on Windows. In return, the people say, Netscape would give 
Microsoft a seat on its board, license its technology to Microsoft, 
give Microsoft advance knowledge of its product-development efforts 
and not make a browser for the next generation of the Microsoft operating 
system, Windows 95, which was shipped two months after the June 1995 
meeting. And Microsoft, the people added, did what it has always denied 
it does _ used access to its technology as a powerful lever in business 
negotiations, by offering Netscape preferential access to the Windows 
``application program interfaces,'' or APIs, the links that enable 
other companies' programs to run smoothly on the Windows operating 
system. By turning down the deal, Netscape, they say, would not have 
that preferred access to Microsoft technology _ a threat that Microsoft 
fiercely denies making. Barksdale, Netscape's 55-year-old chief executive, 
told a colleague that the encounter with Microsoft in June 1995 was 
``the damnedest meeting I've ever attended in 35 years in business.'' 
Had Netscape accepted Microsoft's offer, it would have had Microsoft's 
money and its endorsement. Netscape would have also been free to sell 
its browser for use in earlier versions of Windows and for use on 
other operating systems like Apple's Macintosh and Unix, a powerful 
system used mainly in corporations and research labs. ``But if we 
had licensed our technology to Microsoft and stepped aside, the best 
we could have hoped for was becoming a company with sales of $100 
million or so and hoping to be bought out by Microsoft,'' said Clark, 
a former computer scientist at Stanford University who founded Silicon 
Graphics Inc., a computer graphics pioneer, before starting Netscape. 
``We didn't start Netscape for that.'' For any company, a meeting 
with Microsoft is often a charged affair. Every computing device from 
keyboards to disk drives, and every software program from games to 
browsers, must mesh smoothly with Microsoft's Windows operating system. 
This is necessary to make computers reliable and easier to use, but 
it also gives Microsoft its role as the industry's gatekeeper. And 
since Microsoft itself makes all manner of software products beyond 
the operating system, other companies are put in the uneasy position 
of requiring Microsoft's cooperation to be able to compete against 
it. And in the software industry, where every program is rendered 
in the digital code of 1's and 0's, the lines that divide competition 
and cooperation are often blurred. The talk about that line at the 
Microsoft-Netscape meeting focused on the division between the operating 
system _ the ``platform,'' in computer terms _ and the application 
programs, sometimes called ``solutions,'' that run on top of the operating 
system. The government suit states that in sworn testimony, Chris 
Jones, a Microsoft manager who attended the meeting, ``admitted that 
Microsoft `absolutely' intended to persuade Netscape not to compete.'' 
Microsoft reads Jones' testimony very differently, as evidence mainly 
of the company's clarifying its position. If Netscape stayed on the 
applications or solutions side of the operating system, the two companies 
could be partners, Microsoft said. But if Netscape tried to become 
a player in the platform space, they would compete. Microsoft released 
portions of the Jones deposition in September as evidence that the 
government had quoted the Microsoft manager out of context. Q. Do 
you recall any discussion about a desire of anybody on the part of 
Microsoft who was participating to be able to persuade or influence 
Netscape not to compete? A. Absolutely. But again, persuade in the 
sense of force or persuade in the sense of, hey, we think we can have 
a great business relationship together. Later in the deposition, a 
Justice Department lawyer asked Jones whether any of the Microsoft 
executives intended to suggest that ``there would be any consequences 
to Netscape or its business if Netscape chose to go in the platform 
direction you've described earlier as opposed to the solutions direction.'' 
Jones replied: ``The conversation was something like the following: 
`We're in the platform business. We're going to invest heavily in 
this part of the platform because we feel it's critical to our technologies. 
That's a done deal.' And we're asking them: `What is your business? 
Is your business platforms or solutions? If it's platforms, we're 
in the platforms business. We're competing.''' Microsoft portrays 
such comments as innocuous statements of fact. But to Netscape, the 
same remarks could be taken as a warning, if not a threat. This is 
because Internet browsing software had the potential to become an 
alternative platform to the Windows operating system. The browser, 
sitting on top of the operating system, could supplant Windows as 
the main desktop screen on users' machines and the main layer of programming 
for starting other software applications. In addition, Netscape's 
browser could serve as a powerful platform for distributing and running 
Java, an Internet programming language developed by Sun Microsystems 
Inc., a Microsoft rival. In technical terms, Netscape's upstart platform 
could replace Microsoft's APIs as the essential utility of computing. 
Indeed, Andreessen had boasted in public of Netscape's ambition to 
relegate Microsoft's Windows to so much software plumbing underneath 
the browser. By the June meeting, Microsoft certainly viewed Netscape 
as a serious potential challenger to Windows, the corporate crown 
jewel. On May 26, 1995, in an internal memo, ``The Internet Tidal 
Wave,'' Gates wrote: ``A new competitor `born' on the Internet is 
Netscape. Their browser is dominant with 70 percent usage share, allowing 
them to determine which network extensions will catch on.'' Netscape's 
strategy, Gates wrote, was to ``move the key API'' into the browser 
``to commoditize the underlying operating system.'' THE BROADER INQUIRY: 
GOVERNMENT SEES ARM-TWISTING The federal government and the states 
have recently broadened their allegations against Microsoft by adding 
evidence that it tried to bully Intel, Apple Computer Inc. and other 
companies to squelch competition. They say that like the Netscape 
meeting the new evidence fits a pattern of behavior by Microsoft, 
which has repeatedly tried to limit competition by strong-arming competitors 
and partners. One episode that fits the pattern, the prosecutors contend, 
was an effort by Microsoft to pressure Intel to shelve the development 
of multimedia and Internet software and to limit its cooperation with 
Netscape. Intel's main business is making the microprocessor chips 
that act as the electronic brains of most of the computers that run 
the Windows operating system. Indeed, the fortunes of Intel and Microsoft 
are so closely aligned that the two companies are sometimes referred 
to as a single, powerful entity, ``Wintel.'' But Intel also employs 
hundreds of software engineers, mainly at its Intel Architecture Labs 
in Hillsboro, Ore. And while Intel and Microsoft are partners, they 
have also had their conflicts, typically over the direction and pace 
at which certain innovations should be introduced into the personal 
computer industry, which they dominate together. Federal and state 
investigators have focused on Microsoft's strong reaction to work 
being done by Intel's software engineers _ a sentiment expressed in 
no uncertain terms during a meeting at Intel's Santa Clara, Calif., 
headquarters on Aug. 2, 1995. The contentious session was attended 
by several executives from Intel and Microsoft, including Gates and 
Intel chairman Andrew Grove. An internal Intel memo stated that Gates 
made ``vague threats'' about supporting Intel's competitors and that 
he was ``livid'' about Intel's ``investments in the Internet and wanted 
them stopped.'' Later, Intel did pull back from its multimedia and 
Internet software development. Steven McGeady, an Intel vice president 
who attended the August 1995 meeting, is scheduled to appear as a 
witness for the government. Microsoft replies that the government's 
accounts of meetings like those with Netscape and Intel are fanciful 
distortions, created by using a biased selection of documents and 
witnesses. The government's case, Microsoft asserts, betrays an utter 
failure to accept the computer-industry reality that Microsoft routinely 
meets with companies to make sure their software and equipment will 
work well with Windows. Sometimes the talks, Microsoft says, go on 
to include further levels of cooperation like licensing technology 
or a Microsoft investment, as the company discussed with Netscape. 
In the trial, Microsoft is expected to argue its advance in the browser 
market was the result of its own business acumen and Netscape's missteps. 
To document Netscape's errors, Microsoft issued a subpoena last month 
and obtained the unpublished manuscript of a new book, ``Competing 
on Internet Time: Lessons From Netscape and Its Battle With Microsoft,'' 
which is based on hundreds of interviews with current and former Netscape 
executives. The book does chronicle the mistakes made by Netscape. 
But its authors, Michael Cusumano of the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology's Sloan School of Management and David Yoffie of the Harvard 
Business School, think Microsoft is hardly blameless. ``Microsoft's 
take-no-prisoners strategy backfired, all but inviting retaliation 
from competitors, the government and even customers,'' Yoffie said. 
Emphasizing that he was offering no legal judgment, Yoffie added, 
``I think Microsoft could have achieved 90 percent of what it did 
without crossing the line as much as it did.'' THE SPYGLASS LINK: 
REWARDS AND PERILS OF A PARTNERSHIP On April 6, 1994, Gates and 20 
Microsoft executives gathered for a daylong retreat not far from the 
company's headquarters in Redmond, Wash. The subject was the Internet 
and how it might revolutionize the computer software business. Few 
concrete plans were made that day, but Microsoft executives insist 
that a direction was set. ``Our vision from the outset was to unite 
the two worlds of the Windows desktop and the Internet,'' said Steven 
Sinofsky, a Microsoft executive who attended the meeting. Yet Microsoft 
badly trailed Netscape in the browser field. To hasten its entry, 
Microsoft licensed its early browsing software from Spyglass Inc. 
of Naperville, Ill. The first meeting between the two companies was 
initiated by Spyglass in April 1994. At the time, it was a tiny company 
and eager to do a deal with Microsoft. Spyglass was selected as the 
commercial licensee for browser technology developed by the National 
Center for Supercomputing at the University of Illinois. In the summer 
of 1994, Douglas Colbeth, president of Spyglass, met with Clark of 
Netscape at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago. The two men talked 
in the United Airlines Red Carpet Room, reserved for business-class 
passengers, and Colbeth recalled Clark telling him, ``We're going 
to take Microsoft head-on.'' At the time, Colbeth recalled thinking 
to himself, ``Great, now Microsoft will really want to license from 
me.'' Today, he noted: ``Remember, we were a company with a couple 
dozen people and almost no money in the bank. Netscape had Jim Clark, 
with his money and reputation, and big-time venture capital backing 
from Silicon Valley. Netscape had a very different agenda.'' By July 
1994, Microsoft had become quite interested in the Spyglass technology, 
Colbeth says, and the two companies signed their first licensing agreement 
the following December. Microsoft, Colbeth recalls, always told him 
that it would eventually fold browser technology into its operating 
system, but its timing was accelerated by Netscape's rapid rise. ``Microsoft 
was initially hoping to charge for the browser,'' Colbeth said. But 
on Dec. 7, 1995, Gates declared that Microsoft would not only deeply 
integrate its browser into Windows but would give it away. The announcement 
caught the industry, even Colbeth, by surprise. At the time, Spyglass 
had licensed its technology to 82 other companies, including IBM and 
Digital Equipment, for use in their software products _ a licensing 
revenue stream of about $20 million a year. As a result of Microsoft's 
move, Spyglass saw those revenues vanish within a year, as smaller 
Internet software companies went out of business and big customers 
shifted to Microsoft's free browser. Spyglass slashed its payroll 
and scrambled into new niches of the software industry to replace 
its lost sales, which it succeeded in doing eventually. ``Whenever 
you license technology to Microsoft, you have to understand it can 
someday build it itself, drop it into the operating system and put 
you out of that business,'' Colbeth said. THE NONOPTION COMPAQ: SUDDENLY 
SEES THE LIGHT Well into 1996, Netscape's share of the browser market 
continued to rise, while Microsoft made little headway, even though 
its browser was free. Industry analysts and trade magazines agreed 
that Netscape's browser was the clear technical leader. In April 1996, 
Netscape's Navigator was used by 87 percent of people browsing the 
Web, compared with 4 percent using Microsoft's Internet Explorer, 
according to Zona Research. So the biggest personal computer maker, 
Compaq, thought it made sense to give customers Netscape's browser 
instead of Microsoft's. But Microsoft would not stand for that _ and 
Compaq had no choice but to give in. In June 1996, Compaq wanted not 
only to load the more popular Netscape browser on its machines but 
also to remove the icon for Microsoft's Internet Explorer, which was 
delivered to the computer maker with Windows 95. Microsoft informed 
Compaq that if it removed Internet Explorer, the computer maker would 
lose its license for Windows, said Stephen Decker, Compaq's director 
of software procurement, in testimony to federal investigators. The 
ultimatum from Microsoft was delivered bluntly in a letter headed, 
``Notice of Intent to Terminate License Agreement.'' Faced with being 
denied the essential operating system, Compaq quickly reversed course 
and kept the Internet Explorer icon. Microsoft asserts that Windows 
and Internet Explorer are a single product and that Microsoft alone 
defines what is in the product. Nothing in its contracts, Microsoft 
adds, prohibits computer makers from including competing technologies. 
While the cutoff letter Microsoft sent to Compaq seems an unnecessarily 
hardball tactic when dealing with its largest corporate customer, 
Microsoft chief operating officer Bob Herbold insists that ``to take 
one letter here or one snippet of e-mail there to try to portray Microsoft 
as an arrogant company is unfair.'' Noting that a Compaq executive 
is a witness for Microsoft, Herbold said, ``We are totally dependent 
on tremendous relationships with key companies like Compaq.'' At Netscape, 
however, the Compaq episode was a watershed. ``That was the singular 
act that got me going to the Justice Department,'' Barksdale recalled. 
Barksdale said he regarded Microsoft's tactic of forcing Compaq to 
buy its browser as a condition of obtaining an essential product, 
the Windows operating system, as ``an illegal act and absolute proof 
that Microsoft was a monopolist.'' After investigating the incident, 
the Justice Department and the states agreed with Barksdale that Microsoft 
was illegally tying the sale of one product to another. Microsoft 
replies that it has a long history of adding new features to its operating 
system. And from the outset, Microsoft says, it intended that Windows 
and its Internet Explorer browser would be seamlessly integrated, 
as they are now in Windows 98. Thus, Microsoft insists, there is no 
product-tying violation of antitrust laws. In a separate case, a federal 
appeals court sided with Microsoft, upholding the principle that the 
company could put whatever it wanted to in its operating system and 
declare it a single product. But in June 1996, when Compaq wanted 
to offer the Netscape product instead of Microsoft's browser, most 
industry experts viewed the browser and operating system as two different 
software programs. ``It took a long time for the integration strategy 
to play out,'' said a former senior Microsoft researcher. ``Back then, 
integration was basically bolting a browser onto Windows.'' THE `BALANCING 
ACT': AMERICA ONLINE TOSSES IN TOWEL America Online chairman Stephen 
Case refers to dealing with Microsoft as ``a delicate balancing act.'' 
That balance swung sharply from the fall of 1995 to the spring of 
1996, when Microsoft used the lure of giving America Online a featured 
place on the Windows desktop as the ultimate bargaining chip. To gain 
access to computing's most coveted real estate, America Online agreed 
to make Microsoft's Internet Explorer the main browser for its online 
subscribers, who now number more than 13 million. Yet throughout 1995, 
as Microsoft prepared to introduce Windows 95, the most significant 
improvement ever in its operating system, Case was knocking on the 
door of the Justice Department. His complaint was that Microsoft was 
going to place its new online service, Microsoft Network, a direct 
competitor to America Online, prominently on the desktop screen of 
Windows 95, which was introduced in August. This bundling tactic of 
using the industry-dominant operating system to market Microsoft Network, 
or MSN, Case argued, gave Microsoft an unfair advantage in the young 
but fast-growing online business. The Justice Department listened 
and investigated. But ultimately, the government decided against taking 
any action. At America Online's headquarters in Vienna, Va., Microsoft 
was both feared and loathed at the time. America Online had a designated 
``Microsoft watcher,'' a young M.B.A. who tracked its adversary's 
every move. Above the desk in his small, windowless office was a picture 
of Gates. Beneath the picture, in large block letters, were the words 
``THE ENEMY.'' Though America Online was the clear leader in the online 
services business, it had ample reason to worry about an all-out assault 
by a rival as rich and aggressive as Microsoft. When he had visited 
the Microsoft headquarters a couple of years earlier, Case recalled, 
Gates had bluntly assessed Microsoft's options by saying he could 
buy 20 percent of America Online, all of it or enter the online business 
on his own and ``bury you.'' A threat or merely a statement of the 
facts? ``A bit of both,'' Case said recently. ``But he was mainly 
articulating what everybody at that meeting kind of intuitively understood.'' 
Yet by 1996, Microsoft and America Online found they had reason to 
cooperate. With the exploding popularity of the Internet's World Wide 
Web, the conventional online companies, like America Online and Compuserve, 
had to provide their customers Internet access as well as their own 
services. America Online had its own browser, but to keep pace with 
the rapidly advancing technology it made sense to do a deal with Netscape 
or Microsoft. For both software companies, a deal with America Online, 
which had 5 million subscribers at the time, could mean a big surge 
in browser use and market share. Netscape seemed the natural partner 
for America Online, since both companies were Microsoft rivals. On 
March 11, America Online did announce that it would buy Netscape technology, 
but it was a standard licensing deal based on a payment-for-use formula. 
The next day, America Online announced a more significant deal with 
Microsoft making its browser the default technology _ the browser 
America Online subscribers would use unless they specifically asked 
for Netscape's Navigator. To win the deal, Microsoft offered to give 
America Online a start-up icon on the Windows desktop _ precisely 
the kind of equal treatment on the main Windows screen that Case had 
asked the Justice Department to require of Microsoft. ``After we agreed 
to its Internet Explorer browser, Microsoft allowed us to be bundled 
on the Windows desktop,'' Case said. ``It was an example of Microsoft's 
pragmatic side.'' The pragmatic decision was that the paramount corporate 
goal was to increase browser market share to protect the mainstay 
software business. As a result, its new online service, MSN, would 
have to sacrifice an important marketing advantage over its main rival, 
America Online. ``It was Bill's decision,'' said former MSN general 
manager Russell Siegelman, referring to Gates. ``He sent me e-mail 
on it. He said he didn't think it would hurt MSN that much. I disagreed 
with him.'' To other Microsoft executives, Gates expressed a different 
view of the likely impact on MSN. He told senior vice president Brad 
Silverberg that putting America Online on the Windows desktop would 
amount to ``putting a bullet through MSN's head,'' according to a 
deposition taken by the Justice Department. In the antitrust suit, 
the government asserts that the America Online deal shows how Microsoft 
used the power of its Windows monopoly to give it an edge in the browser 
war against Netscape. David Colburn, a senior vice president of America 
Online who took part in the browser negotiations with Microsoft, is 
a witness for the government. Today, Microsoft has overhauled its 
Internet strategy to focus mainly on building popular special-interest 
Web sites in fields like travel, personal finance, automobile retailing 
and news. And it is putting these sites, along with e-mail and search 
features, in an all-in-one site that uses the name MSN.com. ``I still 
regard Microsoft as a primary threat,'' Case observed. ``Microsoft 
has a history of getting it right in the long run, and there's no 
reason to think it won't in this business as well. We will always 
be in Microsoft's cross hairs.'' THE LESSON: DON'T CONFRONT A STEAMROLLER 
At Netscape's headquarters in Silicon Valley, the strategy today is 
one of avoiding head-to-head competition with Microsoft whenever possible. 
``Don't do something that is in Microsoft's path _ that's the lesson 
learned,'' observed Clark, the Netscape chairman. Silicon Valley's 
venture capitalists, the investors who finance so many of the nation's 
high-tech startups, generally follow the Netscape formula these days. 
Yet that still leaves ample room to prosper. For while competing directly 
with Microsoft is dangerous, the software industry as a whole is an 
engine of wealth creation, job generation and technical innovation. 
And there is an ambivalent side to the venture community's relationship 
with Microsoft. For if a start-up cannot steer clear of Microsoft 
entirely, the favored option is to be bought out by Microsoft, which 
has scooped up many fledgling companies as a way of acquiring promising 
technology and people. ``Microsoft understands start-up innovation 
and how to co-opt start-up innovation better than any other high-tech 
company,'' said James Breyer, managing partner of Accel Partners, 
a venture capital firm. As Microsoft has grown, it has come to be 
seen not merely as a competitor but as a force of nature that shapes 
the business environment, like a weather front. ``Microsoft is incredibly 
pervasive,'' said Stewart Alsop, a partner with New Enterprise Associates, 
a venture capital firm in Menlo Park, Calif. At the board meetings 
of the companies in which his firm has invested, two issues always 
come up, he said: ``One is the price of the company's stock, and the 
other is what Microsoft is going to do.'' In the last few years, Microsoft 
has offered its guidance during almost yearly meetings between senior 
Microsoft executives and leading venture capitalists. The meetings 
are part of Microsoft's effort to improve its sometimes prickly relations 
with Silicon Valley. ``We work hard to provide clarity about where 
we're going and where we're not going,'' said Greg Maffei, Microsoft's 
chief financial officer. Last year's conference took place in October 
at the Quadrus office building on Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park, the 
Wall Street of high-tech venture investing. Maffei led a team of five 
Microsoft executives who appeared before a group of 40 venture capitalists, 
one of whom stood and asked the question that seemed to be on the 
minds of many of his peers: ``How do I invest in a company that stays 
out of the way of the steamroller?'' Maffei, recalled one person who 
attended the meeting, stood up and delivered a brief lecture on businesses 
that Microsoft was likely to avoid. His list included specialized 
software for manufacturing, human resources management, computer-aided 
design and others. But, this person noted, broad swaths of the industry 
appeared to be designated as off limits _ including new software platforms 
that might compete with Microsoft's personal computer operating system. 
At one point, Ruthann Quindlen, a partner with Institutional Venture 
Partners, leaned over to Vinod Khosla, a co-founder of Sun Microsystems 
and a partner at the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield 
&AMP; Byers, and said quietly, ``I guess that leaves us washing machines 
and toasters.''

A federal judge Friday pushed back the starting date of the antitrust 
trial against Microsoft Corp. by four days, to Oct. 19, while also 
ordering the company to comply with the Justice Department's request 
to examine Microsoft's financial records. Microsoft argued that allowing 
``an army of government attorneys to come in and make demands will 
make it very difficult for us to remain in business.'' But after winning 
assurances from government lawyers that they would make only narrow, 
targeted searches of the records, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson of 
the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ordered Microsoft 
to open the database for perusal. Microsoft had asked that the trial 
be delayed several more months to prepare a defense against what it 
said was a last minute broadening of the case by the Justice Department, 
which had added new evidence. Last month, the government said that 
in the process of preparing for the trial it had discovered that Microsoft 
tried to persuade Apple Computer not to market its Quicktime multimedia 
software to Windows customers. On Thursday, the Justice Department 
and 20 states added two new people to their witness list to testify 
about Microsoft dealings with Apple and with Sun Microsystems. Avi 
Tevanian, a former Apple executive, was added to the witness list 
in part to describe Microsoft's proposal, which Microsoft denies ever 
having made. The other new witness was James Gosling, a Sun executive 
who led the development of Java, an Internet programming language 
that Microsoft sees as a potential threat to the company's dominance 
of the software market. The government is charging that Microsoft 
took illegal steps to prevent Java from gaining wide acceptance. To 
counter that, Microsoft named two new witnesses Friday, Robert Muglia, 
a senior Microsoft executive who has worked with Sun, and Chris Engstrom, 
an executive who handled some of Microsoft's dealings with Apple. 
At the same time, John Warden, Microsoft's lawyer, argued that the 
new allegations had no place in the case. The Justice Department, 
Warden told the judge, was ``trying to turn this into something approximating 
a plenary monopoly case like the IBM case.'' ``It becomes clearer 
and clearer and clearer with each new filing that they are trying 
to turn this into a broader case,'' he said. ``You can't have this 
bait-and-switch in which they file a complaint alleging A, B, C, and 
then talk about the whole alphabet three times over.'' As a result, 
Warden said, Microsoft wanted, at a minimum, another two-week delay, 
even though ``a more normal schedule'' would have the trial start 
next year. The judge did not respond. Instead he entered an order 
setting the Oct. 19 trial date. Late Friday, Microsoft entered a formal 
motion asking for another two-week delay. A response is expected next 
week.

Microsoft Corp. has said that material in an unpublished book by two 
business school professors will be a crucial part of its defense in 
the antitrust trial scheduled to begin next week. But judging from 
an advance copy of the manuscript, the Justice Department and 20 states 
that are suing the software giant will find support for their arguments 
in the book as well. To cite one example, Microsoft contends that 
its industry-standard Windows operating system and its Internet Explorer 
browser are a single integrated product. In its suit, the government 
asserts that they are two separate products that Microsoft bundled 
together to get an unfair edge over its rival, Netscape Communications 
Corp., in the market for software used to browse the Internet's World 
Wide Web. In ``Competing on Internet Time: Lessons from Netscape and 
Its Battle with Microsoft,'' the authors, Michael A. Cusumano of the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management 
and David B. Yoffie of the Harvard business school, quote a Microsoft 
executive as saying that only with the third version of Microsoft's 
browser was it integrated with Windows. Microsoft hurried its first 
browser offerings into the market, the book says, in its race to catch 
up with Netscape, then took a more ambitious approach with Internet 
Explorer 3.0, which was introduced in August 1996. In that version 
it changed its software design to use programming modules, or components, 
that could be put together and rearragned like building blocks. In 
the book, Ben Slivka, a Microsoft general manager, is quoted as saying, 
``IE 3.0 was the key thing because we did the componentized browser,'' 
He added, ``We really made Internet Explorer part of the Windows platform.'' 
The timing could be legally significant because in its suit the government 
cites as evidence requests before August 1996 by personal computer 
makers that wanted to load Netscape's browser on their machines instead 
of Microsoft's browser. Microsoft denied the requests, insisting its 
browers and Windows were a single, integrated product. Microsoft's 
legal team obtained an early manuscript of the new book last month, 
by issuing a subpoena to a Netscape executive who was given a confidential 
copy by the authors to review. Microsoft has also sought the transcripts 
of 44 current and former Netscape employees interviewed by the authors. 
A federal judge in Boston last week denied Microsoft access to that 
research materials, but the company may appeal the ruling. The new 
book, published by the Free Press imprint of Simon &AMP; Schuster, 
is being hurried into print so it can be shipped within days of the 
start of the Microsoft trial on Oct. 19. But already, a few quotes 
from Netscape executives have leaked out. The authors decided to send 
the complete manuscript to The New York Times and three other news 
organizations Monday, so that the material could be read in context. 
Microsoft intends to use material from the book as evidence that Netscape's 
troubles resulted largely from its own missteps rather than from any 
alleged predatory practices by Microsoft. The book does detail where 
Netscape stumbled, shifting its strategy too often and running into 
obstacles in its software development efforts. In private antitrust 
suits, the argument that the competitor was his own worst enemy is 
an established defense. But legal experts say that defense may well 
be far less effective in a federal case in which the government is 
seeking court-mandated changes in Microsoft's business practices rather 
than the monetary damages that are the goal of plaintiffs in private 
cases. ``It seems to me that this debate over Netscape's mistakes 
is a total sideshow,'' said Robert Litan, a former senior official 
in the Justice Department's antitrust division, who is now at the 
Brookings Institution. ``But Microsoft has a big legal team, and it 
seems they are working on every defense they can find.'' The book 
quotes a former Netscape executive, Ram Shriram, as saying the company 
bungled a chance to win a sizable share of the browser business from 
America Online Inc. But that was a second-chance to do a deal with 
America Online, the leading online service. The government's case 
focuses on an earlier deal in March 1996, when America Online chose 
Internet Explorer as its preferred browser; in that bargain Microsoft 
agreed to place a startup icon for the online service on the main 
Windows desktop screen _ the prime real estate in computing. For a 
book entitled ``Competing on Internet Time,'' it is intriguing that 
one of its central themes is that Netcape got too wedded to the notion 
that the Internet revolution would change everything quickly. Microsoft, 
by contrast, stuck to its three-year planning horizon that enabled 
the company, the authors write, to ``mesh its short-run tactical plans 
with a broader strategic view of how to win the war.'' The book quotes 
Steve Ballmer, Microsoft's president, as saying, ``The fact of the 
matter is that customers can't take cataclysmic change every three 
months. The organization also can't. You can ship products quickly. 
But you can't say, `Oh, we have a radically new strategy' every three 
months.''

The case of United States vs. Microsoft Corp., the government's most 
aggressive move against a monopolist in almost 25 years, is playing 
out against a century of antitrust laws so broadly worded and court 
rulings so ambiguous that both sides are citing the same rulings to 
support their opposing arguments. Whatever the outcome of the trial, 
scheduled to begin Monday in U.S. District Court in Washington, an 
almost certain appeal will leave to the Supreme Court the task of 
bringing legal order to 100 years of clashing antitrust doctrines. 
The case focuses on Microsoft's Windows, the operating system that 
controls about 90 percent of all personal computers sold today. The 
government says its objective is to curb illegal monopolistic business 
practices that threaten to render large parts of the economy vulnerable 
to the vicissitudes of a single company. Microsoft asserts that the 
case is intended to give the government control over which features 
can be added to Windows. However grand the economic stakes, the legal 
dispute is narrow. The government says that Microsoft's contracts 
with computer manufacturers and with companies that provide access 
to the Internet illegally stifle competition. The contracts prohibit 
manufacturers from substituting Netscape Communications Corp.'s Navigator 
browser for Microsoft's Internet Explorer. They also prohibit them 
from removing from the Windows main screen, or desktop, links to sites 
on the World Wide Web run by Microsoft or its partners. Microsoft's 
contracts with companies that connect people to the Internet and with 
businesses that sell goods and services on the Web require favored 
treatment for Internet Explorer over Navigator in exchange for links 
on the Windows desktop. In the wake of the lawsuit, Microsoft has 
voluntarily dropped some of these requirements, though it could reinstate 
them at will. Microsoft says that its contracts are legal because 
they produce tangible benefits for customers, including easier Internet 
access. The Justice Department says that the bundling of Explorer 
with Windows 95 and the inclusion of the browser as part of Windows 
98 amount to ``tying,'' an illegal practice that forces customers 
of one product to purchase another. The contracts with manufacturers 
and Internet services are illegal, the government says, because they 
are intended not only to create a monopoly in the browser market but 
to protect Microsoft's existing monopoly in operating systems. The 
latter threat is key, according to the Justice Department. Browsers 
have the potential, like an operating system, to act as a software 
platform on which other programs run. So contracts intended to drive 
browsers out of the market would also insulate the Windows monopoly. 
Many antitrust experts say the problem facing the Justice Department 
is that the courts have provided no clear definition of tying and 
no clear guidelines for determining when contracts are illegally exclusionary. 
Professor Lawrence White of New York University, who was chief economist 
of the Justice Department's antitrust division in the early 1980s, 
says that the courts treat tying as an unusual practice when in fact 
it is ubiquitous. No one, he said, ``would challenge the right of 
manufacturers to tie erasers to the tip of pencils, tires to an automobile 
or buttons to shirts.'' His point, shared widely among economists, 
is that some tying benefits consumers if, for example, it results 
in products that are easier to use or enables a company to recover 
development costs. But tying can be bad if it locks in monopoly power. 
The courts, White says, have not offered enough guidance for distinguishing 
good tying from bad, which is the nub of the legal dispute. Microsoft 
says it needs only to show that bundling Windows and Explorer passes 
what might be called a ``gross'' consumer benefits test _ that it 
offers an immediate benefit, whether or not it causes long-term damage 
to competition and, therefore, ultimately to consumers. The Justice 
Department says that Microsoft's practices must clear a higher hurdle: 
yielding ``net'' consumer benefits that are immediate and large enough 
to balance possible long-term harm to competition. So which test of 
consumer benefits satisfies antitrust laws? The simple answer is that 
no one knows for sure, which is why both sides can reasonably cite 
the same cases without fear of embarrassment. Consider a 1985 case, 
Aspen Skiing Co. vs. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., and a 1951 case, 
Lorain Journal Co. vs. United States. In the first, Aspen Skiing, 
the owner of three major ski runs in Aspen, Colo. _ the monopolist 
_ had for years sold a ticket in cooperation with Aspen Highlands, 
a competitor, that gave skiers access to both companies' runs. When 
Aspen Skiing unilaterally canceled the agreement, its rival's revenues 
shriveled and the rival sued. The Supreme Court ruled that Aspen Skiing 
had violated antitrust laws because there was no evidence its action 
helped consumers. In the Lorain Journal case, the only local newspaper 
in Lorain, Ohio, refused to sell advertising to companies that advertised 
on a new radio station. Here, too, the Supreme Court ruled that the 
exclusionary practice did nothing to benefit consumers. Indeed, in 
Aspen Skiing, the court even forced the monopolist to do business 
with its rival, a precedent that augurs well for the Justice Department, 
which seeks to force Microsoft to install Netscape's browser alongside 
its own. But Charles Rule, a legal consultant to Microsoft, says that 
in both cases the courts threw out exclusionary practices only because 
they offered no consumer benefit. The courts, he argues, never pounced 
on practices that resulted in lower prices or better products or service. 
Nor did the courts in either case call for balancing immediate benefits 
against hypothetical long-term harm. Rule argues that Microsoft's 
practices produce demonstrable consumer benefits. Besides, he says, 
unlike the actions taken by The Lorain Journal or Aspen Skiing, Microsoft's 
contracts do not prevent consumers from installing Netscape's browser 
or from using the Web sites of Microsoft's rivals. In truth, though, 
neither case answered what consumer benefit test should apply to product 
design. In Jefferson Parish Hospital District No. 2 et al. vs. Hyde, 
another case cited by both sides, the Supreme Court in 1984 recognized 
that surgeons and anesthesiologists provide an integrated service. 
Yet, the court said, a hospital with monopoly power would still not 
be allowed to force surgical patients to use its panel of anesthesiologists 
if consumers wanted to purchase the two services separately. That 
principle could undercut Microsoft's defense that the functional interdependence 
of Windows and Explorer requires bundling. But Microsoft will point 
to a strong concurring opinion that called for a tougher standard 
for the government to meet when it alleges tying. Microsoft will also 
draw support from several court rulings that allowed IBM to change 
the design of its computers in ways that made it hard for vendors 
to attach peripheral equipment. But perhaps Microsoft's best argument 
is that nowhere has the government identified a single case in which 
the courts explicitly called for throwing out a tied product on the 
basis of a balancing test. The courts, Microsoft will emphasize, steer 
clear of redesigning technically sophisticated products. The Justice 
Department's rejoinder is to note that the sole purpose of antitrust 
law is to protect consumers, so it makes no sense to bless practices 
that provide a dollar's worth of benefits today but, by stamping out 
competition, drive prices up by $1,000 tomorrow. The Justice Department 
will ask the court to at least insist that monopolists use the least 
exclusionary means possible to achieve whatever services they provide 
customers. Experts agree that the courts will subject Microsoft's 
restrictive contracts with Internet companies to a balancing test. 
But exactly how the court will decide whether consumers are helped 
or hurt is up for grabs. A balancing test would have the courts weigh 
the immediate benefits to consumers of one-click access to Internet 
sites and of features of a bundled Windows-Explorer package versus 
the harm over time of diminished competition in the markets for browsers 
and operating systems. But a test that makes good sense in theory 
can prove fiendishly difficult to use in practice. ``Balancing tests 
are impossibly difficult and arbitrary,'' said Rep. Thomas Campbell, 
R-Calif., who is a former law professor at Stanford University. ``The 
practical effect of balancing is to hand defendants like Microsoft 
almost certain victory.'' Microsoft argues _ and many antitrust experts 
agree _ that the courts have in fact gravitated away from a balancing 
test toward a simpler ``predation'' test for exclusionary contracts. 
Under this standard, a contract is illegal only if it is intended 
to drive out competition and thus to pave the way for a monopolist 
to raise prices later. Microsoft will have an easier time defending 
itself against a charge of predation, which amounts to victimizing 
its customers, than it would defending itself against a charge that 
its bundled product does consumers slightly more harm than good. The 
antitrust record, says William Baxter, who headed the antitrust division 
under President Reagan, is littered with ``contradictory, ambiguous 
and sometimes nonsensical'' verdicts. He and other legal experts agree 
that if nothing else, that record leaves plenty of legal leeway for 
the Supreme Court, should it hear the Microsoft case, to stiffen the 
spine of the antitrust law.

The legal tool that the government is using in its assault on Microsoft 
Corp. _ the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 _ is brief, vague and malleable. 
The combination has meant that this bedrock statute of antitrust policy 
has been at turns toothless and powerful over the years, depending 
on the politics and economics of the day as interpreted by the courts. 
Sponsored by Sen. John Sherman, an Ohio Republican who was the younger 
brother of the Civil War general William Tecumseh Sherman, the act 
was passed as a nod to a popular backlash against the rise of the 
industrial trusts in oil, steel and railroads. Farmers, laborers and 
small-business owners _ sizable voting groups _ resented the trusts 
as vehicles of concentrated power. But the trusts, large national 
holding corporations, were viewed by many others as engines of modernization 
and industrialization. Economists at the time opposed the Sherman 
Act, and the law that Congress passed was a vaguely worded compromise. 
No one knew what impact it would have, but one senator, quoted in 
Matthew Josephson's ``The Robber Barons,'' explained that nearly everyone 
agreed that ``something must be flung out to appease the restive masses.'' 
The act's two key provisions, Sections 1 and 2, mention ``conspiracy,'' 
``restraint of trade'' and ``attempt to monopolize.'' Yet while the 
Sherman Act is now interpreted as the Magna Carta of competition, 
it never uses the term. After it was passed, critics of the trusts 
derided the ``impenetrable'' language of the Sherman Act and called 
it the Swiss Cheese Act. But by the early 1900s, the political climate 
had changed. The growing antagonism for the trusts, especially as 
income gaps widened, was tapped by an avowed trustbuster, Theodore 
Roosevelt, who became president in 1901. ``The Sherman Act has always 
been an elastic piece of social legislation, used to attack perceived 
exploitation and the aggregation of power,'' said Eleanor Fox, a professor 
at the New York University Law School. The model trust _ and the principal 
target of the trustbusters _ was Standard Oil. Shrewdly, Roosevelt 
made a distinction between good trusts, which thrived because of their 
superior efficiency, and bad trusts, which grew not as the result 
of inevitable economic forces but because of unfair business practices. 
Throughout the 1880s and '90s, Standard Oil's rivals had complained 
about the company and the business practices of its founder, John 
D. Rockefeller. But during those years, the price of kerosene _ burned 
to light the nation's homes _declined steadily. So Standard Oil, it 
could could reasonably be argued, was an ``enterprising monopoly.'' 
In the early 1900s, though, Standard Oil raised prices in the United 
States to prop up its profits at a time it was engaged in a price 
war against Royal Dutch/Shell in Europe, where Standard Oil did face 
genuine competition. When consumers were hurt by the Standard Oil 
monopoly, popular support for antitrust action against the company 
swelled, encouraged by Roosevelt and his successor, William Howard 
Taft. The federal suit against Standard Oil was filed in 1906, and 
the Supreme Court approved the breakup of the company in 1911. Standard 
Oil and the Microsoft case, historians observe, have some common themes. 
Both were dominant companies of their day, and Bill Gates, the Microsoft 
chairman, has been called a modern Rockefeller. ``But there is no 
presidential involvement and there is no real consumer dissatisfaction 
in the Microsoft case,'' said Ron Chernow, author of ``Titan,'' a 
best-selling biography of Rockefeller. ``And Rockefeller,'' Chernow 
added, ``never went through the kind of honeymoon period of widespread 
public adulation and favorable press coverage as Bill Gates has had.'' 
 NYT19981018.0089 
The government's antitrust scrutiny of Microsoft, the world's largest 
independent software company, has spanned Republican and Democratic 
administrations and involved hundreds of government lawyers and investigators. 
But it has by no means been an example of consistent, coordinated 
public policy. Nor, by all accounts, of politics. Instead, like the 
software industry itself, the government's pursuit of Microsoft has 
taken leaps, hit dead ends and evolved in ways no one could have controlled 
or predicted back when it started in 1989. It was in November of that 
year, on a hot afternoon at a computer-industry convention in Las 
Vegas, Nev., that Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, looked like he'd 
been dragged to the news conference with a senior executive from IBM 
_ which at the time dominated Microsoft and the entire computer industry. 
The two companies _ IBM, then the leading maker of personal computers 
and Microsoft, the leader in PC operating system software _ were collaborating 
on the design and marketing of a new operating system called OS/2. 
But Microsoft was also beginning to sell a competing product, Windows. 
The industry trade press was full of worried articles: which system 
was going to become the new standard? With Gates standing uncomfortably 
at his side, James Cannavino, an IBM divisional president, said that 
the two companies wanted to ``clear the air.'' OS/2 was the future, 
he said. As for Windows, he added, it would remain a niche product 
for under-equipped computers. Windows, he asserted, would never receive 
all the advanced features of OS/2. Gates certainly did not look happy. 
But he did not disagree. The news conference got little attention, 
just a few articles deep inside newspapers and trade publications. 
But a few weeks later, Norris Washington, a senior antitrust lawyer 
with the Federal Trade Commission, happened to read one of those articles, 
in Byte magazine. ``IBM and Microsoft have now defined their unified 
vision of graphical operating environments,'' the article said, ``and 
it looks sort of like a U.S. economic model,'' divided into lower-, 
middle- and upper-class products. As Washington saw it, IBM and Microsoft 
were colluding to divide the operating-system market _ a potential 
violation of antitrust law. Soon the FTC staff opened an investigation 
of Microsoft and IBM And since that small first step, Microsoft has 
been under unrelenting scrutiny from federal antitrust investigators 
for a constantly evolving series of allegations and charges, month 
after month, year after year, for the last nine years. Now comes the 
antitrust trial scheduled to begin on Monday, with a multiplicity 
of charges woven of threads drawn from more than a dozen different 
investigative inquiries during that nine-year span. Microsoft, today 
the most feared company in the software business and carrying a stock-market 
value of nearly $234 billion, presents a huge and highly visible antitrust 
target. Yet, while the company's allies ask, ``What is the Clinton 
administration's political agenda in going after Microsoft?'' the 
answer seems to be there is none. In interviews, more than a dozen 
current and former senior antitrust officials _ whether friends of 
the government or of Microsoft _ all say the Justice Department's 
antitrust suit is a natural outgrowth of the previous investigations. 
As for politics, all the officials agreed that the antitrust division 
operates independent of the administration's political considerations. 
Charles Rule was the assistant attorney general who headed the antitrust 
division during the Bush administration, and he is now a Washington 
lawyer who serves as an adviser and advocate for Microsoft. ``When 
I was there,'' Rule said of his Justice days, ``the White House was 
punctilious in terms of never getting involved in whatever we decided 
to do. There was no communication between antitrust and other branches 
of government.'' Asked if he believed that policy had changed under 
the Clinton administration, he said: ``Not really. I've seen nothing 
to suggest it.'' Joel Klein heads the antitrust division now, and 
in an interview dealing with his division's role in the Clinton administration's 
technology policy, not specifically relating to the Microsoft case, 
he said: ``There is no statutory restriction, but as a practical matter, 
civil and criminal prosecutions are invariably carried out without 
any political contact.'' Klein said, by way of examples, that he might 
discuss merger cases involving military or aviation industries with 
the Defense Department or Transportation Department. ``But never the 
White House,'' he said. ``For a significant case, we might call the 
White House and say `An hour from now we are going to hold a press 
conference.' '' ``The last time there was any interference,'' he added, 
``was the Dita Beard-ITT case.'' Mrs. Beard, a lobbyist for ITT Corp., 
was accused in 1972 of having written a memo saying that a $400,000 
donation to the Republican National Convention had ``gone a long way'' 
toward settling antitrust suits brought against the company by the 
Nixon administration's Justice Department. The authenticity of the 
memo was never proved, and Mrs. Beard always denied writing it. In 
any case, Klein says, ``since Watergate, it's been immaculate.'' In 
the case of Microsoft, neither President Clinton nor Vice President 
Al Gore has ever volunteered a comment. In answer to a question during 
a news conference in May, just before the suit was filed, Clinton 
said: ``I have taken the view that I should not comment on matters 
within the Justice Department. At this time, I do not think I should 
depart from that policy on this case, even though it obviously will 
have a big impact on an important sector of our economy. But I have 
to say, based on what I know to date, I have confidence in the way 
the antitrust division in the Justice Department has handled the matter.'' 
Since then, Clinton has said nothing else about the case, publicly 
at least. And Gore, who generally represents the administration on 
technology issues, has never commented at all. In Rule's opinion, 
the administration would be foolish to involve itself, even if it 
were politically acceptable to do so. ``It would be a little odd for 
the administration to push the Justice Department in this suit,'' 
he said. ``It would be a policy mistake and a political mistake. I 
would be hard pressed to explain why they would do that.'' Taking 
sides in the highly charged technology world is dangerous, particularly 
since the Democrats rely on Silicon Valley companies for political 
donations and support. In fact, the present and former government 
officials all said the suit was simply a natural extension of the 
inquiries conducted during the last nine years. They began at the 
FTC. Soon after Washington read that article in Byte, the FTC staff 
opened an investigation of the Windows-OS/2 question. But as has happened 
so often in the following years, turns in the market made the initial 
inquiry irrelevant. Microsoft abandoned its agreement with IBM, and 
Windows quickly grew to be the industry standard, while OS/2 remained 
a cipher. But as that issue faded, once government investigators began 
looking at Microsoft they found other things that troubled them. In 
1991 Washington, who still works for the FTC, informed Microsoft that 
the investigation was being expanded. The agency, his letter said, 
was now trying to determine whether Microsoft was using its dominant 
position in operating-systems software to stifle competition in other 
areas. That general idea lies at the heart of the present suit. One 
former senior FTC official said the commission staff had confidence 
in the case but realized that the Reagan-era commissioners, who had 
to approve any suit, might have a different view. ``We knew the commission 
might have difficulty with a monopolization case,'' the former official 
said. ``They hadn't brought a case in years.'' And in fact, in 1993 
the commission voted 2-2 on the question of whether to file formal 
charges. The deadlock served as a dismissal. Then, a few months later, 
the Justice Department decided to pick up the case. ``It was farther 
along than most cases we got,'' recalled Robert Litan, a former senior 
official in the Justice Department's antitrust division who is now 
at the Brookings Institution. ``Usually a case would be two or three 
people complaining and a few documents,'' he said. ``But this was 
a fully researched record. They gave us the files and briefed us on 
what they had done.'' The Justice Department lawyers picked up the 
same thread. ``The general idea behind our inquiry,'' Litan said, 
``was that they should not be allowed to use their monopoly in operating 
systems to cement a monopoly in other areas.'' In 1995, Microsoft 
and the government reached a consent agreement in which the company 
promised to stop forcing PC makers to buy one copy of a Microsoft 
operating system for every computer sold _ instead of one for every 
computer on which the operating system, MS-DOS or Windows, was installed. 
The company also agreed to stop tying the sale of one software product 
to the sale of another. The charges in the present suit are similar 
in many ways. Even with the agreement, the government investigations 
continued. That same year, Justice Department investigators showed 
up at the offices of Netscape Communications Corp. for the first time 
to ask questions about their next line of inquiry. ``America Online 
had been complaining,'' a senior Netscape executive recalled, ``because 
Microsoft was bundling the Microsoft Network,'' a competing online 
service, ``with Windows.'' Once more, market forces overtook the investigation. 
The Microsoft Network never grew particularly popular while America 
Online prospered and grew. But, not surprisingly, new complaints filled 
the void. In May 1995, Anne Bingaman, the assistant attorney general 
who headed the antitrust division, remarked: ``We get complaints about 
Microsoft all the time. We have become a kind of Microsoft complaints 
center. And we take them very seriously.'' In 1996, Netscape's first 
complaint arrived. In a letter to the Justice Department, Netscape 
said that Microsoft was using its dominance in personal-computer operating 
systems to force or persuade computer makers to favor Microsoft's 
browser, used to explore the World Wide Web, over the one marketed 
by Netscape. The next year the Justice Department formally charged 
Microsoft with violating the consent agreement by tying sales of Windows 
to installation of the company's Web browser on new computers. ``It 
seemed like a slam-dunk violation of the consent decree,'' a natural 
extension of that case, recalled Litan, who had left the department 
by then. A Federal District Court judge agreed, but an Appeals Court 
panel overturned that ruling this summer. In the meantime, last May 
the Justice Department and 20 state attorneys general filed their 
new suit against Microsoft, which is scheduled for trial on Monday. 
It contends that Microsoft has engaged in bundling, tying and other 
predatory behavior similar in many ways to the numerous previous allegations 
and investigations of the last nine years. ``A good part of this case 
is just Round II of the case we dealt with in Round I,'' in the early 
in the 1990s, Litan said. Or, as the former senior FTC official put 
it, ``there's certainly a common thread that runs all the way through 
here.'' But through the years that thread has been twisted, pulled 
and spun by hundreds of different hands.

Shortly before the government filed its antitrust suit against Microsoft 
Corp. in May, Joel Klein, the assistant attorney general in charge 
of the Justice Department's antitrust division, met with a Silicon 
Valley executive. The executive recalls telling Klein that unless 
a case went beyond the Internet browser market, it would have little 
effect on Microsoft's power to stifle competition across the computer 
industry. Klein replied that he understood the computer executive's 
concerns. But he said time was running short and the strongest evidence 
in hand involved Microsoft's battle against Netscape Communications 
Corp. in the market for the so-called browser software used for navigating 
the Internet. ``This is a Netscape case,'' the executive recalls Klein 
saying. But five months later, the case that the government is bringing 
to trial on Monday extends well beyond Netscape and the browser war 
to embrace what it described in a recent court filing as ``a broad 
pattern of anti-competitive conduct'' by Microsoft. Netscape, the 
government insists, is still a prime example of the pattern _ but 
only one of several examples. The 12-person witness list for the Justice 
Department and 20 states suing Microsoft reflects the new evidence 
added to the case since May. James Barksdale, Netscape's president 
and chief executive, will appear first, but he will be followed by 
executives representing a cross section of the nation's high-technology 
companies including Intel, IBM, Sun Microsystems, Apple Computer, 
America Online and Intuit. In bringing a more ambitious, complicated 
case to trial than the one it filed in May, the government has chosen 
a high-risk strategy. The law states that new evidence can be added 
to a suit after it is filed, but not new charges. And so, in his federal 
courtroom in Washington, U.S.District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson 
could decide to rule out some of the new evidence as ranging too far 
afield from the original suit. But if the government wins its broadened 
case, the court-ordered remedies would no doubt be far tougher on 
Microsoft. In May, the government's suggested steps amounted to equal 
treatment for Netscape's browser and Microsoft's browser. But the 
government recently asked that the judge hold a separate hearing on 
remedies, if it wins the case. The remedies under consideration now 
include more basic changes in Microsoft's business practices _ perhaps 
even a breakup of the company _ intended to loosen Microsoft's grip 
on computing. That would be precisely the kind of sweeping reform 
that Microsoft's foes would applaud. ``The government has doubled 
the bet and doubled the stakes,'' said David Yoffie, a professor at 
the Harvard business school who is co-author of the book, ``Competing 
on Internet Time: Lessons From Netscape and Its Battle With Microsoft.'' 
Meanwhile, in the Microsoft camp, the government's strategy is dismissed 
as a desperate act _ taken after a court ruling in June that threatened 
to undermine the antitrust suit. That ruling came in a separate case, 
involving the interpretation of the consent decree that Microsoft 
signed with the Justice Department in 1995. In the June ruling, a 
federal appeals court said that Microsoft could bundle its browser 
with its industry-standard Windows operating system and call them 
one product. The appeals-court ruling would seem to undercut the assertion 
in the government's current antitrust case that the browser and the 
operating system were two separate products, bundled together and 
given away in an effort to thwart competition in the browser market. 
``With the appeals-court ruling in June, the government lost the heart 
of its case,'' said Charles Rule, a former senior official in the 
Justice Department, who is now a consultant to Microsoft. ``So it 
has taken a blunderbuss approach of scrambling to throw everything 
it can find _ even evidence the Justice Department has had for years 
_ into the gun barrel and see what hits.'' The June appellate ruling 
did shake the prosecution team. But mostly it strengthened the hand 
of those within the Justice Department who had been urging that the 
case be broadened, according to people who have worked on the investigation. 
At the same time, they say, new evidence was coming in as the investigation 
moved ahead and prosecutors raced to meet the accelerated trial schedule 
approved by the court. Speed was a priority from the outset, they 
say. The Justice Department and the states filed their suit in May 
to move before Microsoft's new operating system, Windows 98, was introduced 
in June. While not seeking to block the release of Windows 98, government 
lawyers wanted to get to the the courtroom as early as possible as 
PC makers and computer users adopt this latest version of Microsoft's 
Windows operating system, which functions as the central nervous system 
for more than 90 percent of personal computers sold. The key allegations, 
government lawyers note, have not changed since May _ namely, that 
Microsoft illegally used its market power in operating systems to 
defend its monopoly position and to try to extend into new markets. 
``But the only thing that was wrapped up in a bow in time for the 
May filing was the browser,'' said one person who worked on the case. 
``The real game plan was always to get a broader case.'' What is more, 
one person noted, the prosecution team was not at full strength until 
shortly before the suit was filed. David Boies, a renowned courtroom 
litigator and a former partner at Cravath, Swaine &AMP; Moore who 
successfully defended IBM in its 13-year confrontation with the government, 
was named as special counsel for the Justice Department last December. 
But Boies, who left Cravath last year, did not start working full-time 
for the Justice Department until mid-April, because he was still finishing 
private cases for his own firm, Boies &AMP; Schiller. The antitrust 
suit filed in May leaned heavily on the Netscape story, mentioning 
Microsoft's main rival in the browser market some 130 times in the 
complaint and a supporting memorandum. But it also prominently mentioned 
Microsoft's tactics against Sun Microsystems, creator of Java, an 
Internet programming language, and cited it as an ``example'' of Microsoft's 
behavior. ``It was crafted as a template that could be added to without 
much stretching,'' one person involved in the case said. And so, as 
new evidence piled up and seemed to fit into a pattern, Klein step 
by step approved the widening of the case, the person said. And that 
explains, the person continued, how it is that evidence that has been 
in the hands of the Justice Department for years has been added to 
the case since May; only after gathering new evidence did it become 
apparent that the older material fit the pattern of the current case. 
For example, the government has added the contention that Microsoft 
pressured Intel Corp., the big microchip maker and a close partner 
of Microsoft, to curb its development efforts in multimedia and Internet 
software because they might conflict with Microsoft's plans. The government 
contends that the arm-twisting occurred at meetings between the two 
companies three years ago, especially one on Aug. 2, 1995, which was 
attended by Andrew Grove, the Intel chairman, and Bill Gates, the 
Microsoft chairman. Part of the government's evidence in the Intel-Microsoft 
episode is copies of the handwritten notes taken by Steven McGeady, 
an Intel vice president who attended the meetings, and a memo written 
by him on Aug. 28, 1995. The memo, still under court seal, said that 
Gates ``made vague threats'' and was ``livid'' about Intel's investments 
in the Internet ``and wanted them stopped.'' A handwritten note, also 
under court seal, quotes Paul Maritz, a Microsoft executive, as saying 
that Netscape is their ``common enemy'' and that Intel's role should 
be to ``fill in stuff in and around Microsoft's strategy.'' These 
documents were sent by Intel to the Justice Department's office in 
San Francisco in November 1995, in response to a Civil Investigative 
Demand _ a civil subpoena _ served on Intel on Nov. 10, 1995. On its 
own, the Intel material was intriguing, but it became part of the 
antitrust suit only as other evidence surfaced, one person close to 
the case said. The government is contending that Microsoft also tried 
to urge Apple to stop selling its Quicktime multimedia software in 
the Windows market and tried to convince Real Networks Inc. to pull 
back in the market for so-called streaming software. The government 
case has also broadened, people involved in the case say, as more 
witnesses from the industry have been increasingly willing to testify. 
``In the beginning, most people in the industry believed that the 
government would lose and Microsoft would retaliate if they came forward,'' 
one person said. ``But as the strength of our case was perceived to 
improve, more people were willing to come forward, and things snowballed. 
You get Intel, it's easier to get Apple and so on.''

Following is the text of the first two sections of the Sherman Act, 
as passed by Congress in 1890. As the foundation on which federal 
antitrust law has been built, the act has been amended several times 
_ elevating the crime to a felony, increasing the fines and prison 
terms for individuals and setting fines for corporations convicted 
of violating it. In the case of Microsoft, the government has invoked 
the Sherman Act to file a civil suit that seeks to change the company's 
business practices, not a criminal suit that seeks financial penalties. 
An Act to Protect Trade And Commerce Against Unlawful Restraints and 
Monopolies: Section 1. Every contract, combination in the form of 
trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce 
among the several States, or with foreign nations, is hereby declared 
to be illegal. Every person who shall make any such contract or engage 
in any such combination or conspiracy, shall be deemed guilty of a 
misdemeanor, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine 
not exceeding five thousand dollars, or by imprisonment not exceeding 
one year, or by both said punishments, in the discretion of the court. 
Section 2. Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, 
or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize 
any part of the trade of commerce among the several States, or with 
foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and, on 
conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding five thousand 
dollars, or by imprisonment not exceeding one year, or by both said 
punishments, in the discretion of the court.

Will it matter to consumers that Bill Gates isn't a nice guy? Until 
last week, most Americans thought of Gates, the chairman of the Microsoft 
Corp., as a genius and innovator. A nerd perhaps _ but also a self-styled 
visionary who almost single-handedly unlocked the power of the personal 
computer. Monday, however, in a Washington courtroom, the Justice 
Department began painting a different, darker portrait of Gates. In 
an antitrust suit brought by the department and 20 states, the man 
whose company commands a 97 percent share of the market for personal 
computer operating systems is being depicted as a Nixonian schemer 
who will go to almost any length to crush his competition. Product 
innovation, the suit argues, is not a sufficient weapon for Gates. 
Flashing back and forth between snippets of Gates' videotaped deposition 
and e-mail messages he had sent that contradicted his testimony, the 
government sought to establish a pattern of threats and offers of 
payments by the Microsoft chairman. It also sought to cast Gates as 
an obsessed man who feared the tiny Netscape Communications Corp. 
and its potential threat to his domination of the market for Internet 
browsers, the software used to navigate the World Wide Web. Gates 
was portrayed by Justice Department litigator David Boies as a schoolyard 
bully who rides roughshod over the computer industry with a crudeness 
that is in stark contrast to his popular image as a benevolent dictator 
and high-technology guru. According to a document presented by Boies, 
for example, Gates asked America Online executives in 1996: ``How 
much do we need to pay you'' to damage Netscape? ``This is your lucky 
day.'' The implication, Boies said, was that the amount was irrelevant, 
and that Microsoft, with its deep pockets and market dominance, makes 
as many ``offers you can't refuse'' as needed to achieve its goals. 
Microsoft officials are closely watching market surveys for any hint 
that the new image of a bare-knuckled Gates might be detracting from 
the company's world-famous brand name, but they insist that the public 
will continue to draw a distinction between allegations of anticompetitive 
business tactics and the company's software. ``Despite what you're 
reading in the press, people judge us by our products,'' said Mich 
Matthews, head of Microsoft's corporate public-relations office. ``Our 
experience is that people vote with their pocketbooks.'' So far, consumers 
are casting positive votes. Last week Microsoft reported quarterly 
profits of $1.52 billion, a stunning 58 percent increase over the 
level a year earlier. Despite the record profits, some marketing experts 
say that if the public comes to view Gates as a Rockefeller-style 
robber baron, his company and its brand name may suffer. ``When you 
have a company with such a visible chief executive, the CEO is really 
the driver of the brand,'' said David Aaker, a brand marketing expert 
at the Haas School of Business at the University of California at 
Berkeley. ``There is no question this is going to affect Microsoft's 
brand recognition.'' Already there are early warning signals, as political 
cartoons in newspapers across the country bashed Gates last week. 
One showed him holding a globe and saying, ``If you don't play my 
way, I'll take my ball and go home''; another portrayed the Microsoft 
chairman standing next to a henchman dangling someone from a window 
while a Microsoft secretary says to a caller, ``I'm sorry, but Mr. 
Gates is busy teaching a competitor about Windows.'' But some industry 
analysts believe the new view of a Bill Gates who knows how to play 
hardball may not be such a bad thing for his company. The he-said, 
she-said round of e-mail messages being dragged out in court cases 
both in Washington and in Silicon Valley, where Microsoft is locked 
in a legal battle with its archrival, Sun Microsystems Inc., is viewed 
by some as little different from the exaggerated trash talking that 
goes on in professional sports. ``It's like taking what Charles Barkley 
and Michael Jordan say to each other on the ball court'' and turning 
it into something more sinister than it really is, said Paul Andrews, 
co-author with Stephen Manes of ``Gates'' (Doubleday, 1993). Indeed, 
there is evidence that the darker view of Gates and his company has 
so far taken root only in the District of Columbia and in Silicon 
Valley, where the computer industry has long felt the impact of Gates' 
tactics, and where bitterness and distrust of Microsoft are deep. 
In the rest of the country, Gates continues to enjoy great popularity. 
Two weeks ago, while speaking before a crowd of almost 7,000 students 
at Indiana University, a questioner who asked about the Justice Department's 
suit was roundly booed. BILL GATES, WHIPPING BOY c.1998 N.Y. Times 
News Service Is Bill Gates a high-tech Machiavelli, Public Enemy No. 
1 or a threat to the known universe? All three, judging from the numerous 
political cartoons that popped up in newspapers across the country 
last week. From Chattanooga to Boston, cartoonists took delight in 
demonizing Gates, who is facing an unexpected public relations challenge 
as Microsoft's antitrust trial unfolds in Washington. Other cartoons 
ran the gamut from the predictable (a worker, pointing to an aquarium 
in which a large fish is gobbling up smaller ones, saying to some 
visitors, ``Welcome to Microsoft's research and development department'') 
to the weird (a dweebish man hunched in front of a computer screen 
staring at the words: ``Our beloved leader, Mr. Gates, is under attack. 
Leave your possessions. Go to the desert. Await the spaceship''). 
And that was just Week One of the trial. Stay tuned.
