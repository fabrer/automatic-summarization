Police and soldiers on Friday blocked off the street in front of a 
house where members of a terrorist gang are believed to have assembled 
the bomb that blew up the U.S. Embassy, killing 11 people. Wearing 
gloves and masks, detectives from the Tanzanian Criminal Investigation 
Division could be seen searching the yard of the house that is surrounded 
by a high fence. Residents, who were questioned Thursday by Tanzanian 
police and FBI agents, told reporters Friday there were four regular 
visitors to the house. They all came at night and used a white 1989 
Suzuki Samuri, which is in police custody. Two men, Tanzanian Rashid 
Saleh Hemed and Egyptian Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed, have been formally 
charged by a Tanzanian magistrate in the Aug. 7 embassy bombing. Police 
are looking for two other suspects identified Ahmad Khalfan, a Tanzanian 
of Omani origin and Fahad, a Kenyan of Yemeni origin. A relative of 
Hemed told The Associated Press the house in the Bungoni neighborhood 
of Ilala district had been rented by Ahmad Khalfan. The house is south 
of the center of Dar es Salaam and about 6.5 kilometers (4 miles) 
southwest of the embassy building. The relative, who spoke on condition 
of anonymity, said in addition to Khalfan, the three other visitors 
to the house were Fahad, Ahmed and Hussein. He did not furnish second 
names for them, and it was not clear whether Ahmed was the same Egyptian 
charged in the Dar es Salaam bombing. Residents said police showed 
them photographs, but they were not able to identify them because 
it was always dark when they arrived and left. But all were able to 
identify the Suzuki vehicle. Officials believe a 1987 Nissan Atlas 
refrigerator truck actually carried the bomb into the embassy compound. 
It has been identified by its chassis, all that remains. There has 
been speculation that two men in the Suzuiki used a remote control 
device to detonate the bomb. A nearly simultaneous attack in neighboring 
Kenya killed 213 people, including 12 Americans, at the U.S. Embassy 
in Nairobi. U.S. authorities have charged four people in connection 
with the Nairobi blast. Three are in custody in New York, and a fourth 
is a fugitive. Mohamed Sadeek Odeh, one of the three men in custody 
in the United States for the Nairobi bombing, told police in Pakistan 
where he was arrested after arriving from Nairobi Aug. 7 that Ahmad 
Khalfan was a member of the group responsible for the bombing in Dar 
es Salaam. According to the same Pakistani police sources, Odeh identified 
Fahad as being involved in the Nairobi embassy bombing.

German police raided several locations near Bonn after receiving word 
of a terrorist threat against the U.S. Embassy, but no evidence of 
a planned attack was found, officials said Wednesday. Police, including 
agents of an elite anti-terrorist unit, checked several suspects during 
raids in an industrial zone and other sites Tuesday, but no arrests 
were made, said Eva Schuebel, spokeswoman for the Federal Prosecutor's 
Office in Karlsruhe. The agency said it had received ``credible information'' 
that Middle East terrorists had stockpiled arms and explosives at 
the sites, but none were found. The agency's investigation is continuing, 
Schuebel said. ``For now, we can no longer speak of an immediate threat 
to the U.S. Embassy,'' she said. The embassy had no comment. Security 
was tightened at U.S. installations worldwide after the Aug. 7 bombings 
of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Saudi dissident Osama 
Bin Laden is wanted by U.S. officials for those attacks. A suspected 
top aide of bin Laden, Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, is jailed in Germany 
pending a U.S. extradition request, raising concern about reprisals 
on German soil. U.S. authorities charge Salim helped finance, train 
and arm members of a terrorist organization, including the alleged 
bombers of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. In September, 
German police stepped up security at the U.S. consulate in Hamburg 
after receiving a tip about a possible threat.

An Islamic militant group on Thursday threatened to retaliate if Saudi 
dissident Osama bin Laden is arrested, and described Washington's 
No. 1 enemy as a ``hero'' to Muslims worldwide. Bin Laden, believed 
to be in Afghanistan, and a top aide were indicted Wednesday by a 
U.S. District Court in the U.S. embassy bombings in Africa and are 
accused of conspiring to kill Americans outside the United States. 
The State Department also announced a reward of up to dlrs 5 million 
for bin Laden's capture. ``It is a challenge to the entire Muslim 
world ... Bin Laden is a hero of the Muslim world,'' said Omar Warsi, 
a leader of Pakistan's militant Sunni Muslim group, Sipah-e-Sahaba, 
or Guardians of the Friends of the Prophet. ``If anything happens 
to him, America will be responsible.'' Many Sipah-e-Sahaba followers 
are fighting in neighboring Afghanistan alongside the Taliban army, 
which rules 90 percent of Afghanistan and has imposed a strict version 
of Islamic law in those areas. Warsi's group is well-armed with everything 
from machine guns to rocket launchers. In Pakistan, it has been blamed 
in killings of hundreds of Shiite Muslims, whom the group reviles 
as non-Muslims based on a centuries-old dispute over who was the proper 
successor to the Prophet Mohammed. Harakat-ul-Ansar, a Pakistan-based 
organization labeled a terrorist group by the United States, said, 
however, that foreigners in Pakistan ``have nothing to fear from us.'' 
Harakat is considered a strong supporter of bin Laden, and several 
Harakat followers were killed in the U.S. missile attack on alleged 
bin Laden terror sites in Afghanistan. ``What the United States does 
is their business,'' said Abdul Bassit, a Harakat follower. He added, 
however, that the United States should know bin Laden ``is a good 
Muslim, and all the Muslim world thinks he is a good Muslim.'' The 
Taliban say bin Laden is a respected guest who will not be extradited. 
However, they have set up a judicial inquiry to accept evidence of 
bin Laden's involvement in terrorist activity and have promised to 
prosecute him if the evidence warrants it. Washington blames bin Laden's 
group, al Qaeda, for the Aug. 7 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya 
and Tanzania that killed 224 people, including 12 Americans, and injured 
an estimated 5,000 people. The United States retaliated Aug. 20, firing 
Tomahawk cruise missiles at suspected bin Laden training camps in 
eastern Afghanistan. At least 26 people were killed, but damage to 
the area was not considered extensive. The U.S. Embassy in Pakistan 
evacuated nonessential staff and family members prior to the August 
bombing of Afghanistan, fearing retaliation. While some embassy workers 
are back, their dependents and about 30 percent of the staff have 
not been allowed to return. Embassy officials said no fresh security 
warnings followed Wednesday's indictment. Security measures already 
in place include cement barricades blocking the road leading to the 
U.S. Embassy in Islamabad and razor-sharp barbed wire topping the 
brick-walled compound. In the northwestern Pakistani city of Peshawar, 
on the border with Afghanistan, the U.S. consulate is surrounded by 
barbed wire and protected by an armored personnel carrier and dozens 
of armed police.

The Taliban's chief justice accused the United States on Wednesday 
of looking for an ``excuse'' to launch another missile attack on his 
war-shattered homeland. And that excuse is Osama bin Laden, the man 
Washington calls Enemy No. 1 and blames for the Aug. 7 bombings of 
U.S. embassies in East Africa, Justice Noor Mohammed Saqib said an 
interview with The Associated Press. On Aug. 20 the United States 
retaliated by firing Tomahawk missiles at suspected terrorist camps 
in eastern Afghanistan, killing 26 people. According to U.S. intelligence 
sources, the camps were being used to train members of bin Laden's 
al Qaeda terrorist group. ``America is looking for an excuse to fire 
more rockets on our dear Afghanistan and that excuse is bin Laden,'' 
Saqib said. Washington, which has posted a dlrs 5 million reward for 
bin Laden's arrest, hasn't ruled out further attacks on Afghanistan. 
Saqib, who heads a judicial inquiry established by the Taliban to 
investigate the terrorism charges against bin Laden, says the United 
States has become insecure. ``America fears its shadow ... in every 
part of the world it is afraid and sees every danger connected to 
bin Laden,'' he said in an interview in the Afghan capital of Kabul. 
In Afghanistan, bin Laden is considered an honored guest by his Taliban 
hosts. They cite Afghan tradition, which demands the host guarantee 
his guest protection. So far Saqib says he has no evidence of bin 
Laden's involvement in terrorist activities. The Taliban have refused 
to turn over bin Laden to the United States, but they say if there 
is evidence they will try him under Islamic law. In the 90 percent 
of Afghanistan ruled by the Taliban a harsh brand of Islamic justice 
has been imposed, including the death penalty. ``We want good relations 
with the United States and all Muslim and non-Muslim countries, but 
they have to respect our ways,'' he said. Saqib said his inquiry will 
wind up on Nov. 20 and if there is no evidence against bin Laden the 
case will be closed _ at least for the Taliban. ``Bin Laden is not 
a sinful man ... America has been silent ... they have given no evidence,'' 
he said. ``It is too shameful for America who is now seen by all that 
world to have no reason to go after bin Laden.''

NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ FBI agents this week began questioning relatives 
of the victims of the Aug. 7 U.S. Embassy bombing as well as the seriously 
injured on request of the U.S. Attorney's office for the Southern 
District of New York, a U.S. official said Thursday. The blast at 
the embassy building in downtown Nairobi killed 213 people, 12 of 
them Americans, and injured 5,400. In an nearly simultaneous bombing 
of the U.S. Embassy in Dar es Salaam in neighboring Tanzania, 11 people 
were killed and 85 were injured, none of them Americans. The official, 
who could not be further identified, said the questioning was aimed 
at gathering recorded testimony to be used by the prosecution in the 
pre-sentencing phase of the trials of the six men indicted in connection 
with the attack. Wadih El Hage, Mohamed Sadeek Odeh and Mohamed Rashed 
Daoud Al-'Owhali are being held by the U.S. District Court in the 
Southern District of New York. All three have pleaded innocent. Fazul 
Abdullah Mohammed is a fugitive. Saudi exile Osama bin Laden, the 
alleged mastermind of a conspiracy to attack U.S. targets around the 
world, and Muhammad Atef, the alleged military commander of bin Laden's 
terrorist organization, Al-Qaeda, were charged in a separate 238-page 
indictment with murder and conspiracy in the bombings. Bin Laden is 
believed to be living in Afghanistan. U.S. law provides for the trial 
in the United States of those charged in terror attacks against American 
citizens, even if carried out on foreign soil.

The man accused of orchestrating the U.S. embassy bombings in Tanzania 
and Kenya was declared a free man Friday in Afghanistan, where he 
has lived for years with the permission of the hard-line Islamic Taliban 
militia. The Taliban, who control about 90 percent of Afghanistan, 
on Friday closed their three-week inquiry into allegations that Osama 
bin Laden is waging a war of terror against the United States. ``It's 
over, and America has not presented any evidence,'' Afghanistan's 
chief justice, Noor Mohammed Saqib, told The Associated Press in an 
interview at the Supreme Court building in the Afghan capital, Kabul. 
``Without any evidence, bin Laden is a man without sin. ... He is 
a free man.'' The Taliban have told bin Laden, however, that political 
activity is banned and he has agreed to respect that, the Taliban 
information minister said in a statement Friday. The minister, Amir 
Khan Muttaqi, also disputed U.S. assertions that bin Laden is a rich 
man, saying the Saudi dissident has had his foreign assets frozen, 
a claim not immediately corroborated.

The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Oct. 26: Since 
the deadly bombing of two American embassies in Africa in August, 
there has been a troubling accumulation of evidence that the State 
Department inexplicably ignored warnings of possible terrorist attacks 
against the installations. The latest and most disturbing account 
suggests that nine months before the truck bombing in Kenya, the department 
received a detailed description of the planned attack but did little 
to strengthen security at the embassy. The pattern of negligence demands 
examination by the Clinton administration and Congress. Shortly after 
the bombing, the department acknowledged that the American ambassador 
in Kenya, Prudence Bushnell, had earlier recommended that the embassy 
be moved to a safer location. Her advice was rejected. On Friday, 
Raymond Bonner and James Risen of The New York Times reported that 
an Egyptian now believed to have been directly involved in the bombings 
outlined the Kenya plot to American intelligence officials last November. 
Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed's account was so specific _ he said terrorists 
were planning to detonate a truck bomb in the embassy's underground 
garage _ that it called for more than a temporary increase in security. 
Unhappily, it was discounted, even thought to be a ruse to lure the 
embassy into new security measures that terrorists could monitor and 
defeat. The logic of this is hard to fathom, and harder still to explain 
to relatives of the Americans and Kenyans killed in an attack nearly 
identical to the plan Ahmed described. Since the bombings, the department 
has been quick to close embassies temporarily if attacks seem imminent. 
It would be interesting to know if the intelligence behind those decisions 
was any more credible than Ahmed's warning. No one at the State Department 
is happy with the department's handling of security matters, but the 
tendency to blame limited funding and bureaucratic inertia is disheartening. 
Of course, additional money would have made it possible to harden 
defenses at more embassies, and Congress has now added to the security 
budget. But more decisive leadership in the department could have 
assured preventive steps were taken in East Africa.

Federal prison officials have cut off virtually all communications 
for two men being held in Manhattan in the bombings of the U.S. embassies 
in Kenya and Tanzania. A federal prison official said Monday that 
the government moved under a rarely used federal rule that allows 
prison officials to limit an inmate's contacts to prevent future ``acts 
of violence and terrorism.'' A spokesman for the federal prosecutor's 
office declined to say whether the authorities foresaw further threats 
of terrorism. But the law allows officials to impose restrictions 
where they believe there is ``a substantial risk'' that an inmate's 
communications ``could result in death or serious bodily injury.'' 
Under the provision, approved by the Justice Department, prison officials 
may segregate prisoners from other inmates, and cut off their correspondence, 
visits, interviews with the news media and use of the telephone. It 
was not clear yesterday which of these restrictions would be applied 
to the two bombing suspects, Mohamed Saddiq Odeh and Mohamed Rashed 
Daoud al-'Owhali. The rule does permit communications with their lawyers. 
A Bureau of Prisons official in Washington confirmed that the two 
men are joining a group of about six inmates throughout the country 
being held under the restrictions. The total population of federal 
prisons exceeds 108,000 inmates. Others similarly restricted include 
Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, the Egyptian cleric convicted in the conspiracy 
to blow up landmarks in New York, and Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, convicted 
of masterminding the World Trade Center bombings in 1993. Michael 
A. Young, the lawyer representing Odeh, said he was ``somewhat concerned 
because these are pretrial defendants, after all.'' ``You can't punish 
them in advance of any determination of whether they are guilty or 
innocent,'' he said. Leonard F. Joy, al-'Owhali's lawyer, said his 
initial impression is that some of the restrictions could hinder his 
ability to represent his client.

A federal grand jury in Manhattan returned a 238-count indictment 
Wednesday charging the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden with conspiring 
to bomb two U.S. embassies in Africa in August and with committing 
acts of terrorism against Americans abroad. Government officials immediately 
announced that they were offering two rewards of $5 million each for 
information leading to the arrest or conviction of bin Laden and another 
man charged Wednesday, Muhammad Atef, who was described as bin Laden's 
chief military commander. Bin Laden is believed to be living in Afghanistan 
under the protection of the Taliban, the Islamic fundamentalist movement 
that rules that country. Atef's whereabouts are unknown. Prosecutors 
also unsealed an earlier indictment, issued in June, that included 
similar but less detailed charges against bin Laden. That indictment 
was returned before the embassy bombings and was the result of a two-year 
investigation into his activities in Somalia and Saudi Arabia, as 
well as reports that he had connections to a circle of Islamic militants 
in Brooklyn. The new indictment, which supersedes the June action, 
accused bin Laden of leading a vast terrorist conspiracy from 1989 
to the present, in which he was said to be working in concert with 
governments, including those of Sudan, Iraq and Iran, and terrorist 
groups, to build weapons and attack American military installations. 
But the indictment gives few details of bin Laden's alleged involvement 
in the embassy attacks. The indictment does not, for example, specify 
whether prosecutors have evidence that bin Laden gave direct orders 
to those who carried out the attacks. Nothing in the document indicates 
why the original indictment was kept secret for months, but the secret 
charges were returned about the time that American officials were 
plotting a possible raid into Afghanistan to arrest bin Laden. Mary 
Jo White, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, said, ``It's very common 
to have sealed indictments when you're trying to apprehend those who 
are indicted.'' Both indictments offer new information about bin Laden's 
operations, including one deal he is said to have struck with Iraq 
to cooperate in the development of weapons in return for bin Laden's 
agreeing not to work against that country. No details were given about 
whether the alleged deal with Iraq led to the development of actual 
weapons for bin Laden's group, which is called Al Qaeda. The government 
said Wednesday that bin Laden's group had used private relief groups 
``as conduits for transmitting funds'' for Al Qaeda. The groups were 
not identified. Prosecutors also said bin Laden's group had conducted 
internal investigations of its members and their associates, trying 
to detect who might be acting as informants, and had killed those 
who had been suspected of collaborating with ``enemies of the organization.'' 
The government indicated earlier that its knowledge of bin Laden's 
activities stemmed in part from the cooperation of one such informant, 
who it said Wednesday had worked for bin Laden, transporting weapons 
and explosives, helping to buy land for his training camps and assisting 
in running his finances. While the June indictment against bin Laden 
suggested that the government had a great deal of knowledge of his 
dealings in the months before the embassy attacks, the new charges 
are an indication of how quickly the government has worked to solve 
the embassy attacks, which occurred just three months ago. Ms. White 
said bin Laden was charged with ``plotting and carrying out the most 
heinous acts of international terrorism and murder.'' Citing the more 
than 250 people killed in the embassy attacks and the more than 1,000 
wounded, she added, ``In a greater sense, all of the citizens of the 
world are also victims whenever and wherever the cruel and cowardly 
acts of international terrorism strike.'' The investigation of bin 
Laden is continuing, said Ms. White and Lewis D. Schiliro, assistant 
director of the FBI in New York, whose agents have fanned out around 
the world to look into the embassy attacks. ``Our investigative strategy 
is clear,'' Schiliro said. ``We will identify, locate and prosecute 
all those responsible, right up the line, from those who constructed 
and delivered the bombs to those who paid for them and ordered it 
done.'' 
 NYT19981110.0432 
A federal district judge agreed Tuesday to review complaints by lawyers 
for three men arrested after the bombings of two U.S. embassies in 
Africa that their jail conditions in Manhattan are unconstitutional 
and inhumane. Judge Leonard Sand of U.S. District Court in Manhattan 
said he had received an eight-page letter from lawyers for two of 
three defendants in custody in Manhattan. The lawyers complained that 
their clients were being held in total isolation for almost 24 hours 
a day in a unit called 10 South, the most restrictive holding area 
in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in lower Manhattan. The defendants 
are allowed only brief periods of exercise in a barren room, called 
the rat cage, a defense lawyer, Michael Young, wrote in the letter. 
A second lawyer, Leonard Joy, concurred with the views in the letter, 
which was made public Tuesday. In agreeing to review the conditions, 
Sand said, ``Certainly it has to be addressed, that is, the condition 
of confinement for all of the defendants.'' The judge made his comments 
in the first hearing in the bombing case since last week's indictment 
by a federal grand jury of Osama bin Laden, who the authorities believe 
was the mastermind of the embassy attacks. Bin Laden remains at large 
and is believed to be living in Afghanistan under the protection of 
the Taliban, the Islamic fundamentalist movement that rules that country. 
In discussing conditions at the Manhattan jail, the lawyers said that 
two of the defendants have not been able to call their families, while 
the third has been allowed to make only one phone call. The lawyers 
added that the defendants cannot have visitors, write letters, or 
receive mail or books. The skirmishing continued in court. ``I cannot 
give my client a dictionary,'' a third lawyer, Bruce McIntyre, who 
represents Wadih el Hage, told the judge. El Hage has been charged 
with conspiring to kill Americans abroad and has been described by 
the government as a former personal secretary to bin Laden. The two 
other defendants in court Tuesday _ Mohammed Saddiq Odeh and Mohamed 
Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali _ have each been charged with separate counts 
of murder in the deaths of more than 200 people in the embassy attacks 
in Kenya and Tanzania on August 7. All three men have pleaded not 
guilty. Patrick Fitzgerald, an assistant U.S. attorney, told the judge 
that the government would have a response by Friday, and his comments 
suggested that the government will be prepared to make some modifications 
in the restrictions.
