The commander of Lebanon's army will become the country's next president 
after winning the crucial backing of Syria, the powerbroker in Lebanon. 
``Congratulations, your excellency the general,'' Lebanese Prime Minister 
Rafik Hariri told army commander Emile Lahoud in a telephone conversation 
Monday that was headlined on the front-page of the leftist newspaper 
As-Safir. Lebanese media said the matter was settled Monday at a meeting 
in Damascus between outgoing President Elias Hrawi and Syrian President 
Hafez Assad, whose country dominates its weaker, smaller neighbor. 
Agriculture Minister Shawki Fakhoury, a Hrawi confidant, said Tuesday 
that Lahoud is expected to be elected by the 128-member Parliament 
at an extraordinary session on Oct. 15. The election is a formality 
since other candidates have little chance now that Syria has thrown 
its weight behind Gen. Lahoud. In another formality before the election, 
the Parliament will amend the constitution, which forbids senior public 
servants from running for president. The new president must be sworn 
in on Nov. 24, the day Hrawi leaves office at the end of his six-year 
term. The choice of Lahoud, a Maronite Catholic, will continue a 55-year-old 
tradition under which the president is a Maronite, the prime minister 
a Sunni Muslim and the Parliament speaker a Shiite Muslim. Agreement 
among the three officials is essential for the smooth running of the 
government. Since Lahoud has a good relationship with Hariri and Speaker 
Nabih Berri, little change was expected in government policy. Lahoud's 
nomination ends weeks of suspense over the identity of the next head 
of state. Lahoud, a 62-year-old naval officer trained in Britain and 
the United States, enjoys wide public and political support at home 
and has good relations with Syria. But the choice could not have been 
sealed before a final say from Assad, who keeps 30,000 troops in this 
country. His word is referred to in the Beirut media as ``the password.'' 
Lahoud, elevated from rear admiral to general and appointed army commander 
in 1988 amid a rebellion in the fractured military during the 1975-90 
civil war, is credited with rebuilding the 55,000-strong Lebanese 
army and in ending the reign of militias. In Lebanon, the army commander 
heads the air force, navy and the ground forces. Many hope he will 
copy his success with the military in government, which is plagued 
by nepotism and waste of public funds. But some fear that a military 
man in the nation's highest office could mean a return to the use 
of intelligence services to track civilian life _ the case under Fouad 
Chehab, the only other army commander to become president, who ruled 
from 1958 to 1964. ``The election of a military man is a threat to 
democracy in Lebanon,'' Raymond Edde, a Christian politician living 
in self-imposed exile in France, told the An-Nahar newspaper.

A Cabinet minister and a close Syria ally on Wednesday criticized 
the Syrian-backed choice of the army commander as president, and said 
he will boycott a vote to elect the military man for the executive 
post. Walid Jumblatt, the minister for displaced persons, said he 
and his party's three legislators will not vote when the 128-member 
Parliament elects the president, likely sometime before Oct. 23. Although 
a boycott by Jumblatt's Progressive Socialist Party will hardly spoil 
the chances of Gen. Emile Lahoud, it could embolden others to express 
discontent at the choice and the process of his election. Lahoud is 
virtually assured of the job: the prime minister and the parliament 
speaker first approved Lahoud, who then won the all-important backing 
of Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon. ``Historically, we do 
not approve that a military man takes control of the country,'' Jumblatt 
told reporters after a meeting with outgoing President Elias Hrawi. 
Although opposition to Syria's hold on Lebanon's politics is common 
among anti-Syrian politicians, it is rare for somebody like Jumblatt 
to openly speak against a decision personally cleared by Syrian President 
Hafez Assad who keeps 30,000 troops in Lebanon. Like Jumblatt, some 
in Lebanon fear that a military man as president could mean intelligence 
agents will track civilian life just as they did between 1958 and 
1964 during the presidency of Fouad Chehab, the only other army commander 
to become head of state. In nominating Lahoud, ``rules were not respected,'' 
Jumblatt said. ``Things were supposed to run in a more democratic 
way,'' said Jumblatt, whose Druse militia fought Christian forces 
during the 1975-90 civil war. The new president must be sworn in on 
Nov. 24, the day Hrawi leaves office after a six-year term. Jumblatt 
said ``there is adequate political diversity and competition in the 
country,'' implying that choosing a military man for president was 
unnecessary. Deputy Prime Minister Michel Murr sought to calm fears 
about military intrusion. He told reporters that Lahoud will ``keep 
the army out of politics just as he kept politics out of the army.'' 
Lahoud, a 62-year-old naval officer, enjoys wide public and political 
support at home and has good relations with Syria. He gained public 
admiration for reuniting an army fractured by civil war and in ending 
the reign of militias. Many hope he will cleanse the government of 
nepotism and wastage of public funds. Lahoud's nomination complies 
with a tradition that the president be a Maronite Christian, the prime 
minister a Sunni Muslim and Parliament speaker a Shiite Muslim. The 
government is run by the joint efforts of the three officials. Jumblatt 
said his party will also boycott a Parliamentary session to amend 
the Constitution so that senior public servants can run for president. 
Criticism of the nomination process also came from a meeting of Catholic 
bishops on Wednesday. Nevertheless, the bishops welcomed the choice 
of Lahoud, a fellow Catholic, a statement said. 
 APW19981013.0301 
Lebanon's Parliament on Tuesday ratified a constitutional amendment 
to clear the way for the election of the army's commander, Gen. Emile 
Lahoud, as president. Lahoud has received the backing of Syria, the 
main power broker in the country, making the election by Lebanon's 
pro-Syrian Parliament later this week just a formality. A total of 
113 deputies voted for the amendment and four deputies against, including 
the general's cousin, Nassib Lahoud, a presidential aspirant. Eleven 
deputies were absent. Among those who were absent was Walid Jumblatt, 
a Cabinet minister who had said he would boycott the session to protest 
the choice of a military man even though Lahoud has wide public and 
political support. The 128-member legislature is expected to meet 
Thursday to elect Lahoud after outgoing President Elias Hrawi signs 
the constitutional amendment. The amendment to Article 49 of the constitution 
revokes a ban on senior civil servants from running for the presidency. 
The new president will be sworn in Nov. 24, the day Hrawi leaves office. 
Hrawi has served for nine years, including a three-year extension 
in 1995 to his six-year term. Lahoud, a Maronite Catholic, will keep 
alive a 55-year-old tradition under which the president is a Maronite, 
the prime minister a Sunni Muslim and the Parliament speaker a Shiite 
Muslim. Lahoud, appointed army commander in 1989 amid a rebellion 
in the fractured military during the 1975-90 civil war, is credited 
with rebuilding the 55,000-strong Lebanese army and in ending the 
reign of militias. Many hope he will copy his success with the military 
in the government, which is plagued by nepotism and waste of public 
funds. But some fear of military dominance of public life.

Prime Minister Rafik Hariri's efforts to win a fourth term in office 
have hit a snag after he failed to receive the expected speedy appointment 
from new President Emile Lahoud. Hariri is still the front-runner 
to form the next government but Saturday's Daily Star newspaper quoted 
sources as saying that Hariri was ``outraged'' that only 62 of the 
128 members in Parliament declared their support for him during a 
meeting with Lahoud Friday. According to the constitution, a president 
must begin his term by appointing the prime minister and a Cabinet 
through a decree issued after consulting with Parliament members. 
A presidential decree was expected Friday but nothing came through 
after a meeting between Lahoud and Hariri. Hariri had even scheduled 
Friday a traditional meeting between the prime minister-designate 
and former prime ministers, but that was canceled. The state-run National 
News Agency said that while only 62 deputies told Lahoud they supported 
Hariri, the rest refused to divulge their choice or left it to the 
president to decide. A TV station owned by Hariri said he won the 
backing of at least 100 deputies. The delay reflects the tug-of-war 
among the power brokers in the country. Under a formula aimed at preventing 
the recurrence of the 1975-90 civil war, power in Lebanon is shared 
equally by a Maronite Christian president, a Sunni Muslim prime minister 
and a Shiite Parliament speaker. While the Christian Lahoud may have 
no objection to appointing the Sunni Hariri, it is possible that Parliament 
Speaker Nabih Berri's 19 Shiite supporters in the legislature are 
holding out to emphasize their value. The leading An-Nahar and other 
newspapers said the delay could last for days. But in the end, it 
is Hariri that is most likely to be renamed on the strength of his 
record in office. Hariri, Lebanon's top businessman, has almost single-handedly 
created a multibillion dollar program to rebuild a country destroyed 
by the civil war. He is also credited with stabilizing the currency 
and restoring confidence in the postwar economy. But his government 
under former president Elias Hrawi were dogged by accusations of corruption. 
Hariri, who has been prime minister since 1992, was appointed three 
times during the extended term of former President Elias Hrawi. He 
has remained in office as caretaker prime minister since Lahoud succeeded 
Hrawi on Tuesday. Lahoud, a general who as army commander rebuilt 
the military from 1989 until his election by Parliament in October, 
has pledged in his inauguration speech Tuesday to clean up the corruption-plagued 
administration.

Prime Minister Rafik Hariri has declined an informal invitation from 
Lebanon's new president to form the next government, sparking a political 
crisis in this country as it rebuilds from its devastating civil war. 
Sources close to the prime minister, whose Cabinet has been in care-taker 
capacity since last Tuesday's swearing in of Emile Lahoud as president, 
said Hariri turned down the invitation from Lahoud to select a new 
Cabinet. There has been no formal announcement from Lahoud reappointing 
Hariri as prime minister. Although Hariri's move could be a bargaining 
tactic, since he remains the front-runner for the premiership, the 
apparent tension between the two powerful men could affect Lebanon's 
economic stability as it recovers from the 1975-90 civil war. Hariri, 
53, the architect of Lebanon's multibillion dollar postwar reconstruction 
program, has been in power since 1992. A billionaire businessman who 
made his fortune in Saudi Arabia, Hariri is credited with restoring 
economic confidence and stabilizing the national currency. Lahoud, 
62, commander of Lebanon's army who was propelled to power with widespread 
popular backing, pledged in a tough inauguration speech to clean up 
the graft-riddled administration. The British-trained general made 
his name rebuilding the army after it disintegrated in the civil war. 
Previous disputes among government leaders have cost the Central Bank 
hundreds of millions of dollars in its efforts to stabilize the Lebanese 
pound. Such political disputes in Lebanon in the past were solved 
only with the intervention of Syria, the main power broker in this 
country. Damascus supports both Lahoud and Hariri. Lahoud had been 
expected to issue a presidential decree last week asking Hariri to 
form the next government. The decree was to be issued after the president 
polled members of the 128-seat Parliament on their choice for prime 
minister. But many legislators, who in the past gave their overwhelming 
support to Hariri, did not name him and, instead, left it to the president 
to select a prime minister. The two leaders met Friday, but no presidential 
decree followed. The sources close to Hariri, speaking on condition 
of anonymity, said the prime minister's decision to bow out came because 
he did not feel Lahoud was following constitutional procedures in 
selecting the premier. The Hariri camp argues that the president can 
poll Parliament members on their choice for prime minister but cannot 
accept a mandate to name a person of his choice. The dispute, in fact, 
appears to be the opening salvo of a struggle on how Lebanon will 
be governed during Lahoud's six-year term. Toward the end of former 
President Elias Hrawi's nine years in office, Hariri virtually had 
a free hand in running the country.

Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, the business tycoon who launched Lebanon's 
multibillion dollar reconstruction from the devastation of civil war, 
said Monday he was bowing out as premier following a dispute with 
the new president. He accused President Emile Lahoud of violating 
the constitution and demanded that he acknowledge it before he could 
reconsider his position. Hariri's move could be a ploy to gain more 
power as a new government is formed, but the crisis atmosphere generated 
by the possible departure of the billionaire businessman could affect 
Lebanon's economic recovery. ``I'm not a candidate,'' Hariri said 
in a live interview with CNN. He demanded that Lahoud admit that he 
acted unconstitutionally by allowing 31 Parliament deputies to authorize 
him to name a prime minister instead of naming one themselves. Such 
an action ``might put the country in danger,'' Hariri warned. Asked 
if there was a risk of renewed conflict in Lebanon over the alleged 
tampering with the constitution, Hariri said: ``If the president continues 
with this, I don't know what will happen.'' But the dispute between 
the two leaders appears to be over who will have the upper hand in 
governing the nation of 3.2 million. Lahoud, 62, is an army commander 
who wants to assert his authority at the start of his six-year presidential 
term. Hariri, 53, virtually has had a free hand in running the country 
since he became premier six years ago under former President Elias 
Hrawi. A brief meeting on Monday between the two did not help resolve 
the disagreements. Hariri's Cabinet has been serving in a caretaker 
capacity since Lahoud's inauguration last Tuesday. Lahoud on Monday 
set the stage for choosing a new prime minister when he scheduled 
a fresh round of consultations with Parliament for Tuesday and Wednesday. 
In a statement, Lahoud said Hariri was asked but declined to form 
the next government after a previous round of consultations. The offer 
came after the 128 legislators polled by the president gave Hariri 
a majority but fell short of the near unanimous backing he had received 
in his previous three mandates since 1992. Hariri is credited with 
restoring economic confidence and stabilizing the national currency. 
His globe-trotting travels to drum up political and economic support 
were sometimes instrumental in drawing international financial aid 
and investment. But he was faulted for declining living standards 
at home and a rise in corruption in government. Lahoud pledged in 
a tough inauguration speech to clean up the graft-riddled administration. 
The general enjoys widespread popular backing after succeeding in 
rebuilding an army fractured by civil war. Central bank officials 
on Monday tried to calm fears about a run on the Lebanese pound by 
announcing that the bank was ready to intervene with its foreign currency 
reserves if necessary, the state-run National News Agency reported. 
It added that the money markets remained stable.
