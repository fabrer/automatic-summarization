Hours before China was expected to sign a key U.N. human rights treaty 
and host British Prime Minister Tony Blair, police hauled a prominent 
human rights campaigner in for questioning Monday. Qin Yongmin's latest 
run-in with the authorities came as he tried for the second time in 
a week to legally register a human rights monitoring group. Qin said 
a civil affairs official in the Hubei provincial capital of Wuhan 
accused him of engaging in illegal activities. The police came soon 
after he returned home. ``As I'm sending this statement, the Wuhan 
Public Security Bureau is again taking me away,'' Qin said in a hastily 
scrawled message on the bottom of the typed statement faxed to reporters. 
Qin, detained briefly two weeks ago, was questioned for about three 
hours before being released and threatened with prosecution if he 
persisted in trying to set up his China Human Rights Observer. Qin 
hoped the harassment would stop after China signs the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, but he said if local authorities 
don't observe the treaty ``we will unswervingly push ahead with protecting 
human rights to the last.'' China plans to sign the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights on Monday at the United Nations. 
By the time the ink is dry, Blair should be landing in Beijing on 
Tuesday morning for the first visit by a British prime minister in 
seven years. The treaty is supposed to guarantee freedoms of speech 
and assembly. But even after China signs, the treaty would not come 
into force until ratified by the legislature, which may attach reservations 
effectively nullifying some provisions. Blair has vowed to discuss 
differences over human rights with Chinese leaders. His visit has 
drawn appeals from dissidents and an international press freedom group 
urging him to persuade Chinese leaders to free political prisoners. 
In an open letter, three dissident said that while Chinese leaders 
say they respect human rights principles, in law and practice the 
government allows rights abuses and persecution of dissidents. Thousands 
of political prisoners are believed to remain in Chinese prisons, 
labor camps or detention centers, said the letter, a copy of which 
was released by the Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights 
and Democratic Movement in China. The letter called for the release 
of Shi Binhai, a journalist who compiled a popular book on political 
change; Fang Jue, a businessman who called openly for political reform; 
and other imprisoned activists. Paris-based Reporters Without Borders 
urged Blair to call for the release of Gao Yu, Liu Xiaobo and Liu 
Jingsheng. The three are among 13 journalists imprisoned ``simply 
for attempting to practice their profession,'' it said in a statement.

China released a respected, but ailing labor rights campaigner from 
a prison work camp Sunday and immediately sent him into exile in the 
United States. Releasing Liu Nianchun appeared to be an attempt by 
the government to blunt international criticism over Monday's upcoming 
trial of prominent dissident Xu Wenli. Xu is the third leading member 
of a would-be opposition political party put on trial for subversion 
in a three-week crackdown that has seen at least 32 dissidents arrested 
or interrogated. Beijing police Sunday detained one of Xu's China 
Democracy Party colleagues, Zha Jianguo, to prevent him from attending 
the trial, Xu's wife said. Although pleased that Liu Nianchun was 
free, human rights groups decried the Chinese government's timing 
as manipulative. ``We don't want to give any credit to the Chinese 
government for this cynical game it is playing,'' said Xiao Qiang, 
director of New York-based Human Rights in China. After 3 1/2 years 
in prison, Liu was taken from the Tuanhe labor camp on the outskirts 
of Beijing, driven to the capital's airport and put on a Canadian 
Air flight, ultimately bound for New York, his mother and brother 
said. Accompanying Liu into exile was his wife, Chu Hailan, and their 
11-year-old daughter, the family said. Liu Nianchun's release follows 
the same pattern China used in freeing its two most famous dissidents, 
Wei Jingsheng in Nov. 1997 and Wang Dan in April. Authorities released 
Liu on medical parole, exactly five months before the end of his prison 
term, provided he go into exile, said his brother and exiled democracy 
campaigner, Liu Qing. Liu Nianchun, 50, has been in ill-health for 
at least two years. In an exam authorities finally agreed to provide 
last month, doctors discovered Liu had tumors in his mouth, stomach 
and bowels, Liu Qing said. Like Wang and Wei, the United States and 
other Western governments have lobbied China to release Liu. Chinese 
leaders have been forcing well-known dissidents into exile throughout 
the 1990s, finding that once abroad they lose their influence among 
dissidents at home. In the only official comment on the release, the 
Xinhua News Agency reported that judicial departments took into account 
Liu's health and behavior in the labor camp in approving his parole 
for medical treatment. ``I am very happy for Liu Nianchun, but at 
the same time sending people directly from prison into exile is a 
type of human rights violation and persecution,'' Liu Qing said in 
a telephone interview from his home in New York's Brooklyn borough. 
Liu Nianchun was one of the most respected figures in the fractured, 
persecuted dissident community. His more than 3 1/2 years in prisons 
and labor camps was a sad illustration of the way China's Communist 
Party rulers punish people they deem a threat. Liu was imprisoned 
three times in the past 17 years. His last arrest came after he signed 
a petition calling for labor rights in May 1995. Liu was never put 
on trial. Fourteen months passed before his wife, Chu Hailan, first 
learned of his fate and whereabouts: a three-year spell in a labor 
camp in the frigid, remote northeast. His term was the maximum police 
may impose on criminal suspects without trial. Labor camp officials 
later extended Liu's sentence by a year for trying to escape, a charge 
Chu claimed was fabricated. Inside the labor camp, Liu once started 
a hunger strike to protest his treatment. He was beaten with cattle 
prods and confined to a room of 2 square meters (2 square yards) where 
he could only sit or stand. His wife endured police harassment, beatings 
and detentions in campaigning for his release. Chu was dragged away 
and hit by security forces when she tried to hand a letter to U.N. 
human rights chief Mary Robinson outside a Beijing hotel in September.

Trying to deflect foreign criticism of a crackdown on democracy campaigners, 
China sent a respected labor rights activist from jail into U.S. exile 
Sunday even as it prepared to put a prominent dissident on trial. 
Xu Wenli's trial Monday and his almost certain conviction would deprive 
a nascent opposition political party of a potent organizer and a moderate 
voice. He is the third and most influential leader in the China Democracy 
Party tried in a three-week campaign that has seen at least 32 members 
detained or questioned. For organizing the party and thereby challenging 
the ruling Communist Party, Xu, 55, is accused of subverting state 
power, a crime punishable by 10 years to life in prison. To prevent 
supporters from rallying outside Beijing's No. 1 Intermediate People's 
Court, police detained two of Xu's colleagues Sunday and kept watch 
on the homes of at least two others, friends and a Hong Kong-based 
rights group reported. As police moved against Xu's friends, labor 
rights campaigner Liu Nianchun was taken from a prison camp outside 
Beijing and, with his wife and daughter, was put on a plane to Canada 
and then New York, his first taste of freedom in more than 3 1/2 years. 
Authorities released Liu on medical parole five months before the 
end of his sentence provided he go abroad, said his brother, exiled 
democracy campaigner Liu Qing. His wife claimed for two years that 
Liu's health was worsening. But only last month did authorities grant 
a comprehensive exam. Doctors found tumors, perhaps cancerous, in 
the 50-year-old's mouth, stomach and bowels, Liu Qing said. The timing 
of Liu's exile and Xu's trial was the most brazen in a string of high-profile 
dissident releases calculated to influence Western governments. Human 
rights groups immediately denounced Liu's release as cynical and manipulative. 
``The Chinese government continues to play hostage politics with no 
true commitment to international human rights standards,'' said Xiao 
Qiang of Human Rights in China, a New York-based lobbying group that 
Liu Qing heads. Over the past two years, as China tried to woo the 
West, Beijing signed two key U.N. rights treaties and won praise for 
bringing its spotty legal system closer to international standards. 
The ruling Communist Party relaxed some controls on dissenting views 
among academics. Xu Wenli and other dissidents saw opportunity in 
the more open atmosphere. Over the past six months, dissidents in 
14 provinces and cities have tried to use Chinese laws to set up and 
register the China Democracy Party. In a sign of the opposition party's 
appeal, 205 dissidents from across China issued a petition Sunday 
calling for the immediate release of Xu and two other leaders, the 
Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic 
Movement in China reported. To wipe out the opposition movement, authorities 
have violated recently revised laws that are supposed to protect the 
rights of criminal suspects. They rushed Xu and fellow leader Qin 
Yongmin to trial with less than four days notice given to their families, 
instead of the 10 required by law. Qin and a third principal organizer, 
Wang Youcai, were also denied legal counsel. Police detained or scared 
off prospective lawyers, forcing the two to argue their own defenses 
in separate trials on Thursday. No verdicts have been announced. The 
Beijing court appointed Xu a lawyer, but his wife, He Xintong, suspects 
it is merely a formality in what she expects to be a show trial. ``He 
hasn't even read the whole indictment. How is he going to represent 
my husband?'' He Xintong said after talking with the lawyer and his 
aide. Authorities have turned down requests by Xu's colleagues to 
attend the trial, and He said she has been given one pass, for herself. 
Xu edited an influential dissident journal in the Democracy Wall movement 
20 years ago and spent 12 years in prison, most of them in solitary 
confinement. Since his parole ended last year, Xu has played the role 
of elder adviser to dissidents. He became openly involved in the China 
Democracy Party in November, organizing the group's branch in Beijing 
and nearby Tianjin. Shortly before his arrest, he called on party 
members and exiled dissidents to convene a nationwide congress. 
 APW19981221.0236 
In stern judgments capping a decisive crackdown on dissidents, Chinese 
courts sentenced two prominent democracy campaigners to 13 and 11 
years in prison Monday for trying to organize an opposition political 
party. The 13-year prison term given Xu Wenli after a 3 1/2-hour trial 
in Beijing was the longest for a Chinese dissident in three years. 
His colleague in the China Democracy Party, Wang Youcai, was sentenced 
to 11 years, in a verdict announced by a court in Hangzhou four days 
after his trial. Xu's conviction deprives the would-be opposition 
group of a potent organizer and the fractured dissident community 
at large of a strong and moderating voice. Xu remained defiant during 
his tightly controlled trial on subversion charges. He refused to 
answer questions from prosecutors and judges and responded only to 
those from his lawyer, the court-appointed attorney, Mo Shaoping, 
said. When the court asked if he would appeal, ``Xu Wenli said he 
would not appeal,'' Mo said, quoting his client as saying ``this is 
political persecution.'' Xu's daughter also criticized the verdict. 
``All he wanted to do was to advocate free speech and make sure the 
party registers peacefully. But the government failed this test, and 
now my father has to go to jail again for it,'' said daughter Xu Jin, 
a graduate student at Boston University. Security forces have orchestrated 
a concerted crackdown, trampling China's slim legal safeguards to 
crush the China Democracy Party. In three weeks, at least 32 people 
have been detained or questioned and Xu, Wang and another leading 
member, Qin Yongmin, have been put on trial. All three were charged 
with trying to subvert China's Communist Party-led system. Xu and 
Qin were given less than four days to prepare their defenses. Last 
Thursday, Wang and Qin faced trials without legal counsel after police 
detained or scared off potential lawyers. No verdict has been announced 
in Qin's case. Judges in Beijing and Hangzhou found that Xu and Wang 
plotted subversion by founding branches of the China Democracy Party 
in both cities and accepting money from abroad, the official Xinhua 
News Agency said in a rare mention of dissident activities. The courts 
ruled the two should be ``severely punished'' as repeat offenders, 
Xinhua said in an indirect reference to their previous democracy campaigning. 
Wary of the China Democracy Party's appeal, scores of uniformed and 
plainclothes police sealed off Beijing's No. 1 Intermediate People's 
Court Monday for Xu's trial. Foreign reporters were kept 500 meters 
(yards) away from the building. Xu's wife was the only friend or family 
member given permission to watch the proceedings, along with an audience 
selected by court officials. She was escorted from her home to the 
courthouse by three plainclothes officers. Hours after the verdict, 
He Xintong still had not returned home nor had she contacted her daughter. 
Police detained at least two of Xu's democracy party colleagues and 
kept watch on the houses of others. ``Members of the China Democracy 
Party will struggle to the end for the realization of democracy,'' 
said Gao Hongmin, whose home was under surveillance. Gao, who helped 
Xu organize the party's Beijing branch, said authorities would not 
be able to arrest all the party's supporters. In just six months, 
the party attracted enough of a following to try to register branches 
in 14 provinces and cities. The U.S. government and exiled dissidents, 
many of whom supported the party's efforts, denounced the sentences 
and called for the dissidents' release. ``We are deeply disappointed 
with both the guilty verdict and the extremely harsh sentence given 
to Mr. Xu,'' said U.S. Embassy spokesman Bill Palmer. ``No individual 
should be arrested, tried or sentenced for exercising internationally 
recognized freedoms.'' Xu, 55, edited an underground journal in the 
Democracy Wall movement 20 years ago and spent 12 years in prison, 
mostly in solitary confinement. Since his parole ended last year, 
he has been behind-the-scenes advisor to a host of dissident activities. 
He supported Qin Yongmin, another Democracy Wall veteran, in setting 
up an independent human rights monitor and advised others to run for 
local legislative seats in Beijing. Xu became openly involved in the 
China Democracy Party in November. Wang Youcai, a student leader of 
the Tiananmen Square democracy demonstrations in 1989 and now 32, 
publicly declared the China Democracy Party's formation in June and 
said the group intended to challenge the Communist Party's 49-year 
ban on opposition politics. Police have sporadically detained supporters 
of the democracy party. The decisive move came on Nov. 30 as Chinese 
Communist Party leader Jiang Zemin returned from Japan, ending a busy 
two years of diplomatic forays. In a speech broadcast nationwide on 
Friday, Jiang warned against subversives trying to bring down the 
system and vowed never to copy Western democracy. To allay international 
criticism, China released a respected labor rights campaigner, Liu 
Nianchun, from 3 1/2 years in prison camps on Sunday and sent him 
into exile in the United States.

German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, who drew China's anger recently 
by meeting with exiled dissident Wei Jingsheng, said China's sentencing 
of two dissidents Monday was unacceptable and flouted an international 
treaty the country recently signed. ``The reaction of Chinese authorities 
is totally unacceptable,'' Fischer said, calling for the dissidents' 
immediate release. ``The accused simply tried through peaceful means 
to exercise their right to free speech and assembly, which are guaranteed 
by China's constitution,'' and by the United Nations' International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which China recently signed, 
Fischer said in a statement. Chinese courts sentenced dissidents Xu 
Wenli and Wang Youcai to 13 and 11 years for trying to organize an 
opposition political party.

The trials of three outspoken dissidents over, Communist Party leader 
Jiang Zemin signaled Wednesday that China will sustain a crackdown 
on dissent throughout next year. In his second hard-line speech in 
six days, Jiang vowed to crush any challenges to Communist Party rule 
and preserve social stability. He demanded that officials ``talk politics'' 
_ a euphemism for following party orders. The speech, to senior law 
enforcement officials, used uncompromising language heard less frequently 
over the past 18 months as Chinese leaders sought to improve relations 
abroad. Jiang's harsh tone punctuated the summary trials and convictions 
for subversion this week of three political critics who tried to form 
an opposition party. To underscore the party's intolerant mood, national 
newspapers ran brief accounts Tuesday and Wednesday of the 13-, 12- 
and 11-year prison terms given to Xu Wenli, Qin Yongmin and Wang Youcai. 
Dissidents are rarely mentioned by official media, and the reports 
served as a warning to China's 1.2 billion people. In the speech, 
reported by state television, Jiang said stability was crucial over 
the next year. He noted two key events on the political calendar: 
the 50th anniversary of Communist Party rule on Oct. 1 and China's 
recovery of the Portuguese colony of Macau on Dec. 20. ``We must strengthen 
the ideological and political education of officials and raise their 
awareness of and resistance to the sabotaging acts of hostile domestic 
and foreign forces,'' China Central Television quoted Jiang as saying. 
``Whenever any element that undermines stability raises its head, 
it must be resolutely nipped in the bud.'' Jiang did not exclusively 
target political enemies. He likened their threat to that of white-collar 
and ordinary criminals and ticked off a list of potentially volatile 
problems _ inefficient state industries, legions of laid-off workers, 
stagnating farmers' incomes and corrupt officials. The emphasis on 
stability and warnings to those who would disrupt it were reminiscent 
of party pronouncements in the waning years of Jiang's mentor, Deng 
Xiaoping. After Deng died in 1997 and Jiang emerged victorious from 
a major party conclave, he projected a more confident image. Reform, 
not stability, were the bywords of the past year. Academic debates 
over the past year were the boldest in 10 years by China's relatively 
controlled standards. Party leaders too touted efforts to build a 
more comprehensive, predictable legal system and won praise from Western 
governments for signing U.N. rights treaties. ``Our active developments 
of foreign affairs has reached new achievements,'' Jiang said. ``Our 
country's stature has risen a step higher.'' By arresting and convicting 
Xu, Qin and Wang in less than three weeks, China trampled its own 
legal safeguards for criminal suspects and raised questions about 
its commitments to U.N. rights treaties it signed over the past 15 
months. Despite the swift punishments given the three, dissidents 
have continued to campaign for justice. Four elder members of the 
dissident community sent a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan 
and U.N. human rights commissioner Mary Robinson calling on China 
to stop persecuting political critics and release political prisoners. 
``We have experienced extreme disappointment, worry and shock'' over 
the long sentences given Xu, Qin and Wang and the recent detentions 
of several other Chinese, the four wrote in a letter dated Tuesday 
that was released by New York-based Human Rights in China on Wednesday. 
In addition, 214 dissidents in China planned a 100-day series of rotating 
24-hour fasts beginning Thursday to protest the sentences, the Information 
Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China reported Wednesday 
night. The fasts were to have begun with lawyer Wang Wenjiang, whom 
authorities prevented from representing Wang Youcai, and Wang Zechen 
in Liaoning province in northeastern China, but the two activists 
were detained by police Wednesday evening, the Hong Kong-based center 
said. The British ambassador in Beijing, Tony Galsworthy, and others 
delivered a protest message to the Chinese government demanding the 
immediate release of Xu, Qin and Wang, the Foreign Office in London 
confirmed on Wednesday. It was conveyed on behalf of the European 
Union, the United States, Canada and Norway. 
 APW19981224.0149 
His friend and political mentor is jailed, robbing their budding opposition 
political party of its most potent organizer, but Zha Jianguo is not 
afraid. A bag packed with toothbrush, toothpaste and medicine lies 
ready at his Beijing home for the day Chinese police take him away. 
He has told police interrogators he expects to be jailed, likely for 
a few years less than the 13 given China Democracy Party leader Xu 
Wenli on Monday. ``Democracy is a process, and in that process a small 
number of people will be sacrificed,'' Zha, a 47-year-old former manager 
of a computer design company and vice chairman of the party's Beijing 
branch, told The Associated Press in an interview Thursday. ``We want 
to use our sacrifice to arouse the people, and we believe that sacrifice 
is worthwhile.'' With a mixture of defiance and cool clarity about 
the chances for success, Zha said he and other China Democracy Party 
members will continue organizing and campaigning for change. His tenacity 
holds despite the summary trials and harsh punishments for Xu, Wang 
Youcai and Qin Yongmin _ prominent party principals from the provinces 
who were sentenced to 11 and 12 years _ and despite threatening signs 
from the ruling Communist Party. Chinese President Jiang Zemin warned 
in a speech published Wednesday that political subversives threatened 
what he called China's fragile social order. ``Whenever any element 
that undermines stability raises its head, it must be resolutely nipped 
in the bud,'' Jiang said. Zha maintains that such tactics are unnecessary. 
In its manifestoes, the Democracy Party espoused peaceful means to 
target ``the undemocratic system, not the political power of the Communist 
Party.'' ``We believe elections held after the establishment of a 
democratic system should decide who has the power,'' said Zha. What 
many the world over consider democracy is legally subversive in China 
for threatening the Communist Party-led system. In the past month, 
authorities have arrested and convicted Xu, Qin and Wang and detained 
or interrogated at least 29 other party members. Police took Zha from 
his home Sunday afternoon and held him for nearly 24 hours to keep 
him from Xu's trial. Until the crackdown, the China Democracy Party 
distinguished itself from past attempts at opposition by its openness. 
Organizers publicly announced their intention to set up the party. 
They tried to register with authorities. Statements were faxed to 
foreign media and human rights groups to circumvent China's state-controlled 
media. Now, the party's members _ about 500 by Zha's count _ are being 
driven underground. Party members will concentrate on increasing ranks 
and will be more guarded in the use of telephones and faxes and their 
occasional meetings, Zha said. ``If Xu and the other two were the 
first round, then the second round is very likely and it will be bigger,'' 
Zha said. ``In such an unbalanced contest, we are forced to use more 
secretive means.'' The arrests of Xu, Wang and Qin deprive the party 
of its more influential members, Zha said. All had proven track records, 
Xu and Qin as dissident editors in the Democracy Wall era movement 
20 years ago, Wang as a student leader of the Tiananmen Square democracy 
demonstrations in 1989. ``But from another aspect, this has strengthened 
the resolve of even more party members to struggle on,'' Zha said 
of the arrests. Zha got interested in politics as a radical youth, 
following Mao Tse-tung's appeals to go to the countryside in 1968. 
When he returned to Beijing in 1989, he marched in the Tiananmen protests 
and continued his activism. Friends introduced him to Xu Wenli in 
1995. Having been released from prison two years before, Xu was still 
not openly involved in dissident politics, but he held court in his 
Beijing home to discuss China's future. 
 NYT19981221.0377 
By sentencing two of the country's most prominent democracy campaigners 
to long prison terms, China on Monday took its harshest steps yet 
in its current crackdown on organized political opposition. After 
a trial that lasted just three and a half hours, Xu Wenli _ at 55 
the dean of the dissident movement, and a man who has already spent 
12 years in prison for advocating democracy _ was sentenced to 13 
years for ``subversion of state power.'' Xu's alleged crimes included 
helping to organize a new political party, calling for an end to Communist 
rule in interviews with foreign journalists, calling for independent 
labor unions and, prosecutors said, accepting $500 from a dissident 
abroad. He was defended by a lawyer who was appointed by the court 
just four days ago and met his client only once. Also sentenced Monday, 
to 11 years in prison, was Wang Youcai, 32, founder of the China Democracy 
Party, which has now been suppressed. Wang was tried on subversion 
charges on Thursday in a brief court session, with no defense lawyer, 
in the eastern city of Hangzhou. The punishment of a third veteran 
democracy campaigner, Qin Yongmin, 44, has not been announced. His 
trial began in the central city of Wuhan on Thursday and may reconvene 
on Tuesday, relatives said. A similarly long sentence is expected. 
Monday's sentences, which came just six months after President Clinton's 
visit to Beijing, where he publicly challenged China's leaders to 
move quickly toward political reform, were harshly criticized by the 
State Department. They also appeared to spell the effective end here 
of the China Democracy Party, which these three men, along with hundreds 
of lesser-known individuals, tried to organize in recent months. The 
long sentences also crushed the hopes of many liberal intellectuals 
here that China's warming relations with the United States in recent 
years and its signing of global treaties on human rights might bring 
a significant easing of political controls. Xu was tried Monday morning 
in the Beijing Intermediate Court. When after a brief recess the three-judge 
panel announced his 13-year sentence, Xu stood up and shouted, ``I 
protest!'' said his wife of 28 years, He Xintong. Then, said Ms. He 
and lawyers who were present, he shouted that the judges were unfair 
and that he would not appeal his case because the proceedings were 
illegitimate. With the sentencing of Xu, China's Communist government 
has silenced one of its most energetic and persistent critics, one 
who has given over his adult life to the cause of democracy. Xu first 
came to prominence during the Democracy Wall movement of the late 
1970s, then served 12 years in prison, much of it in solitary confinement. 
In the last several months, sensing a new opportunity to speak out 
and making constant use of fax machines and e-mail, he and Qin tried 
to draw attention to China's obligations under two international covenants 
it has signed _ one on economic and cultural rights, and one on civil 
and political rights. In the face of several temporary detentions 
and stiff warnings, they continued their activities. Wang, in contrast, 
first became involved in dissident activities in 1989, while a graduate 
student in physics in Beijing, when he became a leader of the Tiananmen 
Square demonstrations. After the student movement was smashed by the 
army, he was on the most-wanted list, then was arrested and spent 
two years in prison. During Clinton's visit to China in June, Wang 
announced the formation of the China Democracy Party. Hundreds around 
the country, including Xu and Qin, began promoting the idea. But while 
the government has allowed somewhat freer discussion of political 
topics in universities and obscure journals in the last year, it has 
not allowed any challenges _ in print or in the form of organized 
groups _ to the principle of Communist Party rule. In a speech on 
Friday celebrating 20 years of economic reforms, the president and 
Communist Party chief, Jiang Zemin, emphasized the primacy of the 
party, saying, ``The Western mode of political systems must never 
be adopted.'' After learning of Monday's sentences, the American Embassy 
here, which has spent the last two years building improved relations 
between China and the United States, issued a strong condemnation 
of what it termed the ``deplorable decisions.'' ``We are deeply disappointed 
with both the guilty verdicts and the extremely harsh sentences,'' 
the statement said. ``No individual should be arrested, tried and 
sentenced for exercising internationally recognized freedoms, including 
those guaranteed in the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, to which China has committed itself.'' Like Thursday's trials, 
both of which proceeded with no defense attorneys because prospective 
lawyers had been warned off by police or detained, Monday's proceeding 
showed that in cases involving security issues, police and courts 
could write their own rules. According to the criminal procedure law, 
defendants are to be notified at least 10 days before a trial, but 
Xu was told only four days ago that his trial would be Monday. His 
wife, who until Monday had not been allowed to contact him since his 
arrest on Nov. 30, was told three days ago. Under the law, defendants 
also have the right to a lawyer of their choice, but Xu was assigned 
a lawyer by the court late last week. Before Monday morning's trial, 
the lawyer, Mo Shaoping, saw his client only for one brief meeting, 
an associate of Mo's said. Xu's wife refused to meet the lawyer before 
the trial. ``Meeting him would be tantamount to cooperating with the 
whole charade,'' she said in a telephone interview this weekend. Responding 
to the accusations during Monday morning's trial, Xu's lawyer argued 
that Xu had engaged in the peaceful expression of his own views and 
that this could not amount to subversive activities against the state, 
an associate of the lawyer said. But in a decision that was clearly 
preordained, the court declared Xu guilty and sentenced him to spend 
what may be much of the rest of his life in prison. Born in 1943 in 
the southeastern province of Jiangxi, Xu was interested in politics 
even as a teen-ager, his wife said. In the 1960s, as an idealistic 
Marxist, he decided to get his learning in society rather than attend 
a university. He served in the navy for five years, then became an 
electrician with the Beijing railroad before becoming involved with 
the democracy movement and going to prison. On Monday afternoon, in 
a police station hours after the trial finished, Xu was allowed a 
half-hour with his wife. ``He told me he'd be able to handle the pain,'' 
she later recounted in a telephone interview. ``He said that this 
would give him time to think things over and calmly reflect on what 
has happened.'' Ms. He, who has been married to Xu since 1971, said 
she expected to see him in monthly visits to prison. The couple has 
a daughter, Xu Jin, who is a graduate student in fine arts at Boston 
University. In an earlier interview, soon after her husband was arrested 
on Nov. 30, Ms. He said Xu had told her, ``I can't change the way 
I am.'' If he received a long sentence, he told his wife, she should 
go on and enjoy her life. ``And if I die,'' Xu said as they parted 
that day, ``please plant a tree for me.''

Six months after President Clinton traveled to Beijing and challenged 
China's leaders to move rapidly toward political reform, the administration's 
policy of engaging Beijing was called into question Monday when Chinese 
courts sentenced three of the nation's most prominent dissidents to 
long jail sentences. Critics of China on Capitol Hill and human rights 
groups said the tough prison terms were evidence of the failure of 
the administration's policy of encouraging trade and diplomatic ties 
with China in hopes of democratic reform. The dissidents _ Xu Wenli, 
who was sentenced Monday to 13 years in prison, Wang Youcai, who received 
an 11-year sentence, and Qin Yongming, who was reported to have received 
12 years were charged with subversion. The State Department said it 
had received reports from sources it did not identify that a third 
leading democracy campaigner, Qin Yongmin, had been sentenced to 13 
years in prison after a trial last week in the city of Wuhan. Relatives 
of Qin in China denied the reports, however, and said that his trial 
continued. Given Clinton's effusive praise for China's senior leaders 
during his trip to Beijing last summer, the administration found itself 
on the defensive Monday and harshly criticized the prison sentences, 
even as it continued to insist that the administration's policy of 
engagement was helping push Beijing toward democracy. James Foley, 
a State Department spokesman, said the United States ``deeply deplores'' 
the jail terms and called for the immediate release of the dissidents. 
``These three men appear to have been involved in nothing more than 
efforts to form a new political party,'' he said. While condemning 
the prison sentences, Foley and other American officials were careful 
to note the administration's assessment that there had been progress 
in human rights in China, some of it linked to Clinton's meeting in 
Beijing with Chinese President Jiang Zemin. ``There had been improvements 
in the human rights situation in China, modest improvements,'' Foley 
said. The severe prison terms _ and other recent instances of harassment 
of democracy campaigners in China _ are ``steps backward in relationship 
to what had been an improved human rights performance,'' he said. 
Critics of the administration's China policy noted that the long prison 
sentences were handed out less than a week after Jiang delivered a 
pointed speech in Beijing in which he made clear that China's economic 
reforms were not a prelude to Western-style democracy. ``The Western 
mode of political systems must never be copied,'' he said, adding 
that those who challenged the Communist Party's supremacy would be 
crushed. Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who has long been among China's 
harshest critics in Congress, said the prison sentences handed out 
to Xu and Wang were ``the clearest demonstration'' since the president's 
visit to China last summer of Beijing's ``true intentions regarding 
human rights.'' ``They are pathetic, really pathetic,'' she said of 
the administration. ``The administration can say what it wants, but 
it must know Monday that its policy on China is an embarrassment. 
What the Chinese have learned is that they have all the latitude in 
the world.'' Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington director for Human Rights 
Group, said the jail terms were proof of the need for the administration 
to revise its China policy, which he described as ``almost entirely'' 
driven by the administration's desire to encourage trade. He said 
that while there had been some signs of progress in the human rights 
situation in China over the last year _ notably, China's agreement 
to sign international treaties on civil and economic rights _ the 
overall picture was bleak. ``On balance,'' he said, ``any progress 
China has made by allowing greater openness may have been canceled 
out by a more repressive attitude.'' Human Rights Watch, the largest 
American-based human rights group, called on the administration to 
consider postponing or canceling a planned visit to China early next 
year by Commerce Secretary William Daley and a high-level trade delegation 
as a protest over the prison sentences. ``That would get Beijing's 
attention,'' Jendrzejczck said. Other China experts and scholars insisted 
that the administration was right to continue its policy of engagement 
with China, and that there was reason to believe that political reform 
would follow economic reform, as Clinton has argued. Peter Rodman, 
a former Nixon and Reagan administration official now at the Nixon 
Center in Washington, said that ``the United States cannot control 
the evolution of a society as complex as China's.'' He said the harsh 
prison sentences given out Monday to the dissidents were to be expected, 
especially since Xu and Wang had been involved in trying to set up 
a political party to challenge the Communists. ``The pattern of this 
regime is that every once in a while, they ease up a bit and somebody 
goes too far and there's a crisis,'' he said. ``I don't think you 
can blame the United States for this crackdown, nor can you give us 
credit for any political reforms. On human rights, I just don't think 
there's much more we can do.''
